GodofWar,t3_car8er,Possible cameo in the next games... (Spoilers),"In this game we see Jormungandr who, in Norse mythology, is a child of Loki. What if in the next game we are introduced to his other son, Fenrir, the great wolf who the Odin locks up out of fear.

Now, I've got the language cipher to enter the fire realm, and I've got the resources to buy a full set of purple armour, just not upgrade all of it. Unsocketed the blue and purple sets leave me mid level 4. 
Should I stick with my current upgraded blue set for now or spend resources getting the purple set? Unsocketed the blue set has mildly better stats but either way I'm still level 4. I don't have the resources to upgrade the purple set, that'd take me to level 5 which would be a no brainier.

GodofWar,t3_caswp9,Is that Odin at the end of God of war?,So after the credits roll Kratos &amp; Loki lay down to finally get some peaceful rest. Only to be awoken by a humanoid hooded figure. Who is at this point maybe 20 feet from the front door of the home of Kratos. The hooded figure stands silently as he calls down thunder around himself. Kratos and Loki rush out of the house. Kratos then calls out to the figure‚Äù üó£WHO ARE YOU!‚Äù To which we neither you or Kratos gets an answer. Next thing you know Kratos and Loki awaken to realize that they had been sleep the entire time. I speculate that the hooded figure is Odin. This is completely his style. We have seen Odin visit people in their dreams or give them visions in broad day light. I‚Äôll use an example. Thor Ragnarok! In Thor Ragnarok Odin often visited Thor in his mind. As well as Loki. The thunder is simply a show of power. Odin being the All father has abilities such as thunder and many other abilities as well. Also is we follow true God of war fashion I believe Kratos will fight and kill all of the sons daughters and warriors of Odin before facing the all father himself. I think the next end game boss will be Thor for the next God of war series. I also believe Odin will be the end game boss after the next install of God of war. I believe the purpose of us seeing Odin use this show of power to say to Kratos I‚Äôm watching you. After this last Game this next chapter in the life of Kratos. Odin now has an eye on Kratos. Kratos has the attention of the all father and that is never a good thing. Just ask the giants.,0,public,,1

Everything you've ever known Kratos, will now suffer because of your sacrilege, you will never be the ruler of Olympus, the cycle ends here.""**

That should be what he originally said, but when Kratos rewinds time, right BEFORE he interferes, zeus' dialogue is now **""even now as you draw your last breath, you continue to defy me? *No matter...*""**

He was about to say something before future Kratos interrupted, but why was the dialogue different? Was it accidental or intentional? Did Zeus somehow guess that Kratos would mess with time?

GodofWar,t3_cabxzz,GOW SAGA NORDIC AND MORE... THEORY," Aqu√≠ mi teoria de la secuela, Cuando nos ense√±an el supuesto spoiler de la muerte de Kratos... ¬øy si no muere en esa escena? Osea en el siguiente juego empieza con la pelea √©pica contra Thor que sera interrumpida o no darse por completo ya que sera la √∫ltima pelea como boss final. Kratos sera derrotado por alg√∫n factor en la primera pelea que tengan as√≠ Thor se llevara a Atreus,Kratos tendr√° que emprender camino e ira a por su hijo y al final es posible que suceda la muerte de Kratos que vimos , ya sea porque Od√≠n a manipulado a su hijo para que acabara con kratos ya que sabia que el traer√≠a el Ragnarok o ya que el mato a su hijo o algo ,dando as√≠ al 3 de la trilog√≠a, con Afrodita o Hela (que seguramente aparecer√° en este y le contara a Kratos sobre su hijo Loki quien es el padre de ella y tal para que as√≠ Loki no sepa nada y sea clave en la ecuaci√≥n esta) volviendo de alguna forma en su forma de esp√≠ritu para guiarle al camino para encontrarse con su pasado Espartano por mucho que lo haya evitado volviendo una vez mas del inframundo (aunque con no dejarlo muerto del todo y herido de gravedad o una vuelta por los infiernos n√≥rdicos en vida en plan hacer lo que tiene que hacer y para lo que naci√≥), para dar caza a Od√≠n (como Zeus de esta saga), Thor (Si es que lo dejan vivo si no) su hermano el Dios de la Venganza y algunos (semi-)dioses mas al estilo del 3 y en este s√≠ quiz√°s no sea Kratos qui√©n de el √∫ltimo golpe y acabe con Od√≠n si no ¬øLoki(Atreus)? ¬øQui√©n alomejor cuentan que la madre muere por la culpa de Od√≠n para hacer de Atreus lo que fue con Kratos en el Olimpo,ya que sab√≠a todo lo que fuera suceder? Y Que en esta 3¬™ entrega Kratos si de la vida por el, despu√©s de completar el ciclo traicionar,venganza,serenidad,ser traicionado y dando la vida olvidando la venganza y descansando en paz y que este lo resucite en un final en Fenrir y que a partir de la siguiente Trilogia si es que la hay, sea Atreus el prota quedandose con el nombre en honor a su padre por el nombre que le puso del compa√±ero ca√≠do en Grecia (dejando atr√°s el de Loki) ¬øy que Kratos sea el Lobo que nos acompa√±ara en los siguientes juegos? 

&amp;#x200B;

 Y que por ejemplo una siguiente Saga en la mitolog√≠a Japonesa por eso de ser ¬øGigante,Mortal y Dios?,Cielo,Tierra y Inframundo? o Egipcia y que trate de buscar el Ankh la llave de la vida esa la reliquia del Crash, para revivir a su padre , ¬øpero ahora carrileando √©l?, contra dioses como Ra,Isis,Anubis,Thoth,Osiris y Am√≥n (como Od√≠n/Zeus)...? .La Celta no se porque pero me viene que seria el siguiente y solamente de ATREUS sin acompa√±amiento, para que se le coja cari√±o al personaje ya que no se por eso del dios de los animales y eso,que sea su Grecia que fue para Kratos,para que as√≠ se prepare para alguna de las otras 2.   

&amp;#x200B;

O otra opci√≥n y si Tyr es Atreus (loki del futuro) por eso de ser el dios de la guerra n√≥rdico y que evitara por completo todas las guerras al contrario de su padre ya que le intento ense√±ar eso, pasando asi a Atreus de esta linea temporal resucitando a Loki en Fenrir (la imagen que se ve de alguien muy parecido a Kratos sin un brazo que en realidad es Atreus del futuro (Tyr) con la falda escocesa de su paso por la cultura Celta que se vera en el siguiente juego?) con esta variante tiene sentido que lo dicho anterior suceda para que el hijo fuera a la cultura Celta despu√©s de la muerte de Kratos para buscar respuestas, lo √∫nico que estar√≠a fuera es que Kratos fuera el lobo,el estar√≠a muerto pues hasta que consiguiera Atreus resucitarlo en la cultura Egipcia y as√≠ el dando un √∫ltimo rodeo por la Japonesa (dando un Fan Service de toda la franquicia brutal, con un poquito de todo).   

&amp;#x200B;

PD: Dicho as√≠ parece un refrito de la primera Saga pero con mas profundidad de personaje y la excusa para la venganza jaja aunque ojala fuera as√≠ la verdad me rentaria jajaja es que sabiendo que el creador le encanto la serie cancelada de Star Wars es capaz de hacer un (Palpat√≠n) Od√≠n dando mas profundidad a todo, no tan vac√≠o como la primera saga.   jajajajaj sorry por la paja mental que me mont√© demasiado l√≠o.Aunque si alguien quiere hacer animaci√≥n,o un gui√≥n ya que quieren hacer la pel√≠cula llamad a este numero : xDDDD

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here my theory of the sequel,

When they teach us the supposed spoiler of Kratos' death ... what if he does not die in that scene? Bone in the next game begins with the epic fight against Thor that will be interrupted or not given completely as it will be the last fight as boss final. Kratos will be defeated by some factor in the first fight they have so Thor will take Atreus, Kratos will have to take the road and go after his son and in the end it is possible that the death of Kratos that we saw will happen, either because Odin has manipulated to his son to finish with kratos because he knew that he would bring the Ragnarok or since he killed his son or something, thus giving the 3 of the trilogy, with Aphrodite or Hela (who will surely appear in this and tell Kratos about her son Loki who is her father and so that Loki does not know anything and is key in the equation) returning in some way in his spirit form to guide him on the road to meet his Spartan past no matter how much I have avoided returning once again from the underworld (although not leaving him dead at all and seriously wounded or a return to the Nordic hells in life in plan to do what he has to do and what he was born), to hunt down Odin ( as Zeus of this saga), Thor (If it is left alive if not) his brother the God of Vengeance and some (semi-) gods more like the 3 and in this yes maybe it is not Kratos who of the last blow and kill Odin if not Loki (Atreus)? Who could possibly say that the mother dies because of Odin's fault to make Atreus what it was with Kratos in Olympus, since he knew everything that was going on? And that in this 3rd installment Kratos if life for him, after completing the cycle betray, revenge, serenity, betrayed and giving life forgetting revenge and resting in peace and that this resuscitated him in a final in Fenrir and that from the following Trilogy if there is one, Atreus is the prota staying with the name in honor of his father by the name he gave him of the fallen companion in Greece (leaving behind Loki's) and that Kratos is the Wolf that will accompany us in the following games?

&amp;#x200B;

And that for example a following Saga in Japanese mythology for that reason to be ""Giant, Mortal and God ?, Heaven, Earth and Underworld? or Egyptian and try to find the Ankh the key to life that the relic of the Crash, to revive his father, but now racking him ?, against gods like Ra, Isis, Anubis, Thoth, Osiris and Amun (as Odin /Zeus)...? The Celta do not know why but I think it would be the next and only ATREUS unaccompanied, so that you take love to the character and that is not why the god of animals and that, that is his Greece that was for Kratos , so that it is prepared for one of the other 2.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Or another option and if Tyr is Atreus (loki of the future) because of being the god of the Nordic war and who completely avoided all wars as opposed to his father as I try to teach that, thus passing to Atreus of this line temporarily resuscitating Loki in Fenrir (the image that is seen of someone very similar to Kratos without an arm that is actually Atreus of the future (Tyr) with the kilt of its passage through the Celtic culture that will be seen in the next game? ) with this variant it makes sense that the previous thing happened so that the son went to the Celtic culture after the death of Kratos to look for answers, the only thing that would be out is that Kratos was the wolf, he would be dead then until he got Atreus resuscitate it in the Egyptian culture and thus giving a final detour by the Japanese (giving a Fan Service of the whole brutal franchise, with a little bit of everything).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Said so it seems a rehash of the first Saga but with more depth of character and the excuse for revenge haha ‚Äã‚Äãalthough hopefully it would be true that I would rent hahaha is that knowing that the creator loved the canceled Star Wars series is capable of make a (Palpat√≠n) Od√≠n giving more depth to everything, not as empty as the first saga.

Can any of you help me find it?",8,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_c9k8lz,Tyr knew.,"Going through GOW for the first time and it struck me how all the traps in the temple were design for Kratos with winds of Hel, Leviathan Axe and his strength. No other god would have Kratos's strength beside maybe Thor with the belt on and I doubt Tyr wanted Thor. Giants had the gift of foresight and prophecy so Tyr using that knowledge design his temple for Kratos to overthrow Odin.   


This is probably an old theory but I just got the game and I casually check the search. Didn't see anything like this idea.",598,public,,1

I don't know how far I am into GoW or how long I've played for but I've just killed a dragon, so you could use that to tell how far I am. So far the game has been alright, but I don't get the stuff about it being game if 2018 at all. The combat is obviously really fun and I like the stuff between Kratos and Atreus so far, but it's only slightly above average so far in my opinion. I have a lot of games I still need to finish and I don't know if it's worth finishing god of war if I'm not really into it so far. I know several games where people don't like it until near the end, where they fall in love with the game and I'm wondering if God of war is one of those games.

Gmgow mode
NG+ First new game+ carrying over from gmgow
Just chopped mimirs head and went straight to muspelheim without reviving him

1. I watched videos and I manually saved the game in the travel room. I exit it and receive no skap slag and then once I exit broke shop, which is right after travel room, I recieved the sklag* and exp for visiting muspelheim. 
I reload the game and it starts again in travel room but I dont keep the 9 sklag I got from first save.
I'm guessing that they patched this by recieving sklag from exiting broken shop instead of exiting travel room as most videos show that u receive it after exiting travel room. 
Thoughts?

2. I unlocked the gem of mine enchantment in purple rarity (forgot the name) and was wondering, shouldnt I had received the perfect version? In my last run, I didnt unlock it as I wasnt aware of this missable item.

GodofWar,t3_c9rpgj,Valkyrie bug,"Just found out one of the valkyrie helmets dissapeared from my inventory and I can't get it back. I looked it up and it seems like I'm definitely fucked. I was going to start new game plus after I beat the queen, but now I think im done with it for a while. 

For the record I tried:
Loading older saves
Checked my inventory to see if I already layed it down.
Have made sure im not missing any valkyries
It's not in the lost items, because it literally can't end up there. 

P.s. I was on normal mode, and approached them after I beat the game. But, the valkyries were all way easier then I thought based on the reactions to them on here. I killed half of them on my first try. Their move patterns are really similar, and honestly if you just put a fuck ton of pressure on them it boils down to the same fight each time. I hope there are optional bosses like this In the sequel, but I hope they are way harder, and the regular bosses are as hard as the valkyries (not queen) in this one. Goodbye GOW(2018) it was a lot of fun, and then you ripped it all away.

P.S. 2: I really enjoyed this game a lot, and am not dogging my time with it at all. Definitely deserved game of the year, and it still has so much to improve on. The sequel is going to fucking murder.",2,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_c9eacg,The woman,"Kratos looks off into the distance. The snow-covered mountains before him stretching for miles. He inhales the crisp air and then turns to the woman beside him, ""What is this place?"" The woman doesn't answer and instead produces an ornate vial. She gestures for Kratos to drink from it and puts the vial to his lips. Despite never having met the woman, Kratos somehow feels at ease in her presence. He takes a sip from the vial then pushes it from his lips. The woman follows suit.
""Welcome to Midgard?"" she speaks, as if to test the potion's efficacy. Kratos is surprised to hear the woman's voice. It is unexpectedly pleasant. ""We should make our acquaintances before this potion wears off,"" she continues candidly. There is something in her voice that almost makes Kratos smile. He keeps quiet as the woman walks closer to him. ""I am Laufey, one of the last of my people, and I know a great deal about you and your past, Ghost of Sparta."" The look on Kratos' face shifts and he promptly turns from the woman. ""You know of me?"" he asks concerned. ""I do,"" she affirms as she returns his gaze to hers. ""...and yet, here we are."" Again the comfort of her voice puts him at ease. They linger for a while before Kratos breaks the silence, ""Why bring me here... to this place?"" 
""Midgard?"" she asks, not shifting her gaze from his. ""For one thing, it's safe. No one will come looking for you here."" Her hands graze Kratos' arms where the chains were once seared to his flesh. ""These do not heal at all,"" she remarks concerned. Kratos grunts and pulls his arms from her hands. ""I have made sacrifices and for that I have paid the price."" he responds while tightening the rags covering the scars. ""Cursed"" she remarks almost callously. ""Well, with the exception of magic, time heals all wounds."" Kratos scoffs at her retort. ""And as luck would have it. Time is all we have,"" she smiles as the potion begins to wear off.",142,public,Spoilers,1

GodofWar,t3_c9jd13,Roger Clark for Thor in the next game?,"I'm new to Reddit, so bear with me guys.

I've just finished the latest God of War, I've been a fan of the series since the very first one and absolutely loved this game. I was so impressed by it. After finishing it I immediately looked to see if a sequel was in the works or had been announced because I'm so interested in where the story will go next. 

I saw the message someone decoded from the PS4 anniversary theme and the tweets from Cory Barlog himself regarding ""Ragnarok is coming"" and with Thor obviously being mentioned and referred to in God of War. It then got me thinking on who could play Thor in a sequel game. They've already got a very solid cast from this game and the actor who sprung to my mind immediately was Roger Clark. He's burst out onto the scene with critical acclaim and I think he would fit the role of Thor perfectly. I think the depth he would bring to Thor would be stunning.

GodofWar,t3_c953r7,New Kratos wouldn't make sense without good ol' annoying Kratos,"Although I got the game a year ago, I left it nearly at the beginning. I felt this wasn't GoW. Gameplay was different, atmosphere different. Even found Atreus annoying. Heck, I really missed Terrance Carson's voice. Then, I saw an article that Santa Monica Studios was about to cut out Kratos from GoW because he was annoying. Annoying! Can you believe it? Of course, they didn't and they're happy with the result. So I decided to give it another chance these last couple of weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh boy, what a ride.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't wrong about my first impressions: Kratos is not the furious god I loved to play with in the previous installments. But why should he be? Ultimately, he got his revenge and killed everyone in its path. Now, without the rage there's only remorse. The way he hides his chain scars from Atreus was the first sign of this. But the character development is gold: through out the game you can see how the patience of Kratos goes from 0 to 100. His kindness towards Atreus from -100 to 1000. He even joked around with Mimir. Kratos smiling!

&amp;#x200B;

There are many powerful moments, but the one that really moved me was when they were in Helheim and the image of Kratos was about to kill Zeus appears. The few times I've seen Kratos so defeated and ashamed like that moment were when they showed how he murdered his first wife and daughter. Maybe he was thinking how to explain the situation to Atreus. In turn, Atreus was like 'ok, I see it. No biggie.' Maybe he didn't understand the situation (he's an 8 year old boy, after all), but I felt that for Kratos was a great relief that Atreus didn't judged him. The love of a son.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end, they are a bonded team and Kratos is even capable of express his feelings freely, other than fury, of course. I would've never  imagined that in the old Kratos. In fact, GoW as a standalone is great. The development of father and son relationship is palpable, but having in mind the ""annoying"" Kratos was just yelling, killing and fu... fornicating mindlessly makes even deeper the change of the new Kratos. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I feel that the logical step for the sequel is that Kratos gets killed in the first part of the game (and not by his son). Why? Because he's redeemed himself and would make a proper transition for Atreus (Loki) to be the new gods slayer. In fact, I think that the proper title would be Ragnarok, without ""God of War"". But that's a topic for another post.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is: What a master piece!

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: The development of Kratos as a father and a being with feelings and doubts wouldn't be as powerful if we didn't consider the former ""annoying"" Kratos, were he was just furious and didn't stop for nothing.",415,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_c8zhzs,Need HELP with Niflheim Farming in GmGOW Mode!,"Now that I have finally beaten sigrun on GmGOW in my first playthrough (not ng+), I came here to ask a few questions that some of you may be able to answer.

I already have Ivaldis cursed set at base level, none upgraded. I have the 2 things to do immediately:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Get 2 more anchor of fog - I was lucky to have full rage, do 2 'rooms' before hitting the open field and being lucky yet again to have Ogre enemy type to destroy that field easy. Opening the chest gave me anchor of fog. I need 2 more, my question is, should I either just run through the rooms and go for the 'field' to kill enemies and hope I get anchor of fog or should I do the first 2 rooms and then do the field? I know the chance increases if u have opened chests earlier but does that mean there still might be a chance to get anchor of fog without actually doing the first 2 rooms? Even if its 1 in 25 or 50, is there a chance?  Sometimes I am just not able to beat 2 rooms for some reason, GmGOW doesn't allow walk in the parks. And this is my first playthrough so it also means that I am Lvl 8 at most without the top armor upgraded yet.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Max out Ivaldi's set - Not talking about other resources required that arn't in Nippl...Niflheim, what is the best way to get haze weave at first (since its low in availability for me) and then aesirbane? Should I do the maze (4 rooms) and hope I get from some chests or should I do everything, including 2 fields as well? Im on GmGOW and I can at most do 2 rooms and 3rd field/room if I got some rage meter built up.   My main issue also arises from the fact that things dont die so quick for me. What weapons you suggest I use? I have both of them maxed and I start off by doing runic attacks to let them sit on a cooldown but I can do 2 rooms at most, 3 if the enemies are easy. But the field room has tough enemies for me lol. GmGOW just makes things ridiculously hard. It took me 4 days to beat Sigrun.

I think I missed a key piece of info in the whole time travel story with the serpent. Mimir said that during Ragnarok, the World Serpent's battle with Thor shatters the World tree and sends the serpent back in time, *before his own birth*. Now that we've learned that Atreus (Loki) is J√∂rmungandr's father (as long as the game doesn't stray from this aspect of Norse Mythology), when would the serpent have been born? It would have to be before Ragnarok, right? Seeing how Kratos considerably shortened the amount of time leading to Ragnarok (3 winters), Atreus seems far too young and there simply isn't enough time for him to become a father.",29,public,,1

Sadly GoW does not allow some choice in that department. You're locked for good on the hardest one.

Having started on Give Me a Challenge and knowing how hard the first enemies of the game are, I was wondering if they become 'bullet sponges' and if so, the difficulty is artificially upped by increasing their HP and damage, without adding new flair to the gameplay.

GodofWar,t3_c7sn97,I enjoy my second playthrough a lot more,"I grew up with the first two games on ps2 and absolutely loved them to death.I switched to pc gaming before the ps3 came out, but then decided to move back on console.I owned a xbox one for most of this generation mostly because I got it stupidly cheap, and god damn did I regret that decision.It just wasn't for me, I like single player games and the ps4 exclusives were killing me.When god of war was announced I finally couldn't take it anymore, I started saving money and by the time it came out I had enough for the console and about five or six exclusives(one of them was the remaster of gow3 which I missed)

Gow3 was everything I wanted it to be, I just can't describe the feeling it game me, it was like being a kid again.Non stop action, and the boss fights were unbelievable.This got me even more excited for the new one, especially the ending that hinted to the new direction of Kratos


However..it didn't clicked with me the way I was expecting.Don't get me wrong, I still loved it, but it didn't blew my mind or anything like that, it wasn't a perfect 10 for me.The new camera angle felt wierd, the new Kratos felt wierd, the lack of QTE action(which I know a lot of people hate but I actually really like it lol),very few epic bosses, and having a freaking kid with me all the time, it all felt a bit wierd.The kid grew on me eventually and so did most of the things I mentioned but it still missed something, I really don't know what it was.I obviously shit my pants at that special scene(you know which one) but that was about it.


The wierd thing is that after about a month I found myself thinking back to the game.Like it left a mark on me.I was just randomly remembering parts of it and going ""hmm maybe that wasn't so bad"", ""yeah that dragon fight was actually really fucking cool"", etc.This went on for sooo long, but I was also going through a rough period then, so I said this time I will wait for the right moment and give it a proper second chance.


Three days ago I felt it was the right moment, I was actually more excited than the first time for some reason, and after two hours of playing I had to take a break and figure out what the hell was wrong with me the first time.It's not uncommon for me to like something more the second time, but never on this scale.EVERYTHING was amazing, the music, the acting, the gameplay, so many details I missed the first time.I got goosebumps all over my body when they burned Faye at the beginning, legit goosebumps for a character that is never even shown.That was the scene that made me realize how good the music is, and I played the rest of the game with headphones.I can go on and on describing everything I love now and didn't the first time but this post is already getting too long.I have about a quarter of the story left and I'm seriously considering starting a third playthrough(NG+ this time) right after this one, just because I spend half of this one wondering how could I be so blind.Oh and I'm also getting the platinum for sure.


And one last thing.It felt so good last night to barely be able to fall asleep due to excitement to play again.I don't even remember the last time I felt this.

GodofWar,t3_c7dpi2,The real reason Kratos keeps being called a God and not a Demi-God...,"Is because he became a full god at the end of God of War 3. Think about it, the Blade of Olympus drained his divinity, so it could have been possible to give it back. We just saw an extreme, maybe only, way of doing it. He stabbed himself with the blade in order to release the power of Hope to the world, but I strongly believe that in exchange the divine power that belonged to Kratos returned to his body. Kratos didn‚Äôt notice at the time cause he was bleeding out and then decided to take a dip in the ocean. By the time he came to on the shore of Norway where coincidently his Original blades washed up. Kratos was like ‚Äúhuh I definitely feel more godly than last week, not that I care or anything‚Äù. 

So in summary the other half of Kratos divine power left the sword and went back into him whilst Hope was released. 

I consider it to be a reward and curse for the actions he took in the trilogy. He rid the world of a corrupt and cruel pantheon but at the cost of the land he grew up in. And if he hates all Gods, by being one it gives him more reason to hate himself. Granted I‚Äôm sure he already did deep down, but he was in his ‚Äúi will have my revenge‚Äù phase. Now he hates himself but loved his second wife and loves his BOI.",397,public,Spoilers,1
GodofWar,t3_c7r2bn,TIFU by not saving my sister's playthrough of God of War before gloating about my endgame build,"I know, I'm in the wrong subreddit but i think this would be a better fit here than anywhere else.

My younger sister is a noob and this was her first god of war playthrough. She's been playing on my ps4 account and she played for a week to get halfway through to the ""Return to the summit"" quest. I watched through her playthrough being an absolute knob of a backseat gamer and finally lamented on the state of her armor. Taught her a couple tricks to build her level up for the later stages and she asked me what level i had finished on. So i tell her, I'll show you and I proceed to load up my endgame build.

I showed her the level 8 build i had and gave her a chance to go through the motions in niflheim and proceeded to go out for stuff. Once i got back home, she was screaming and hysterical. I found out that she had never manual saved her game and the moment she played on my save game, her autosaves were deleted. I felt bad about it and offered her I'd play a new playthrough up to the point she left off at to make up for my mistakes. She finally relents and here I am now, 5 sessions in and done with half the game.

The replayability on this game is soo good and the cut scenes were so epic as any god of war game should be, I ended up probably enjoying it much more than I intended. I did manual save it this time and I'm thinking of just creating another save to finish off this playthrough. But then again, I might give newgame+ a go next time.

TLDR: Sister never manual saved game and i loaded my playthrough thereby deleting the autosaves. Had to replay god of war till her progress and had fun all over again.",7,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_c6k631,Theory on the Desolation *spoiler warning*,"While on the bridge in Tyr's Temple, Freya talks about the desolation. I searched most of this reddit but I only found that most people focused on her phrase ""someone has meddled with powerful forces"" although it does still tie in with what I'm about to theorize

I took notice of her phrase saying that the desolation  ""...is a symbol of a world out of balance."" I believe that this refers to the destruction of the Greek Pantheon. 

As we all know, gods in the GoW universe are real, and that every ""land"" has their own pantheon. According to GoW, there are four main pantheons, the Greek, the Egyptian, the Norse and lastly the Japanese mythologies evidenced by the panel in Tyr's temple in Hel. 

Without the Greek pantheon, the GoW Earth is essentially out of balance because I presume that these pantheons are essential for creating and maintaining reality as is. It's like a roof standing on four stand, you take one stand out and the roof...falls a bit because it still has three stands but the stands now are strained because they have to carry the rest of the roof without the other stand.",237,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_c6wbxj,Two questions about tiny details that have been bugging me.,"The first one is inconsequential and probably just ""it's a video game,"" but the second I feel like has some potential significance. Apologies if these have been discussed in the past, you know how the Reddit search function is.

1) After you come back from hunting with Atreus at the very beginning of the game, is the table that Faye's body was laying on just... Gone? I can't really think of a chance they would have had to move it between the cremation and returning. Other than atreus running inside to get his bow, but he was only gone for a few moments and I doubt he could move that table so quickly on his own. Or am I just absolutely COMPLETELY blind?

2) In the Light of Alfheim, one of the sequences has Kratos on a shore walking into a cave. Facing the shore is the Thor statue. Thor's statue doesn't face a shore normally, so this is obviously deliberate. But the shore also has a track in the ground leading from the water to the cave. We can only assume it's from the boat there, but maybe not. The fish flopping about would also suggest the water level went down again? All of these have to be pretty deliberate choices, but I can't seem to wrap my mind around them.",5,public,,1

having world obstacles, such as climbable walls be more fluid and faster to climb with the mix of long jumps and using the &gt;!chains!&lt; to pass between big gaps.

mantaining&gt;! blades of chaos!&lt; and axe while adding other 2 weapons or 3. (such as a spear, 2 handed sword,  daggers) with other types of elements in them ( such as blue lightning)and different flow in gameplay mechanics and combat.

making legendary and epic armour waist slot also cover/ change the appearence from foot to legs.

adding an option to change equiped armour appearence to another one .

keeping the abilities that can be unlocked by xp and  also adding  different types of masteries  trees (maybe 4 or 5)  with perks that can be unlocked by obteining perk points , simillar to ""red orbs"" (from previous games) , that have specific improvements. ex: resolve: reduces damage taken  and finishing moves recover health . elemental: improves runic attacks and makes elements effects twice as powerfull.

GodofWar,t3_c6misa,Oppenheimer (Ghost of Sparta spoilers),"I'm sure this discussion is like 8 years out of date but here it goes...

I just beat Ghost of Sparta, and at the end of the game Kratos says ""what have I become?"" And the grave keeper/Zeus behind him says ""death, the destroyer of worlds."" This is a famous quote by J. Robert Oppenheimer after he helped create the atomic bomb. ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"". I did some googling and found that Oppenheimers relative worked on the game, and this quote is also present in GoW2 as an Easter egg. But disregarding the relative connection, Oppenheimer said he got the quote from a rough translation of the hindu text Bhagavad-gita.

GodofWar,t3_c6cpam,My take on the future of the game,"I believe it's all connected and every little bit is going to affect the future.
- Ragnarok has already started and according to norse mythology, Thor will be killed by the serpent's venom, which is embedded in the leviathan axe after the first encounter between kratos and the serpent. So kratos is going to kill thor and thor kratos.
- Loki is the father of the serpent, Hel and Fenrir. The last is the wilf that kills Odin and also the mother of skoll and hati bringers of day and night. So in essence, these giants children of Loki are therr before Loki was born. Meaning that there was another timeline in which Atreus birthed them and sent them back in time, a perfect and smart plan illustrating the godly power of Loki. And I believe the serpent did not go back in time because of this powerful fight with Thor, he was sent by Loki and the reason he hates thor is because Thor kills his grandpa basically.
The Loki of the first timeline had planned all of this. This is the timeline in which victory happens. With all, of this in mind, I, also think Atreus from the first timeline blew the horn (plus he knew when his young self and his dad would be too busy with the sickness to either see it or give a Damn) 
- Concerning the valkeries, they will basically make sure non of the soldiers of the hall of valhalla would be of threat to kratos and atreus.

One key thing happens in Ragnorok and that is Odin and The World Serpent fight and it shakes the world tree so hard that the world serpent gets sent back in time? A few things...
1. Does the other gods and people get sent back in time because the world serpent said that he recognized Atreus but he is only what 9,10,11 years old? So was there an older atreus Loki already or what?? Sorry if I don't get that!
2. I guess I heard Mimir say that Odin was after the giants because he wanted to predict his fate of Ragnorok but it had to have already happened since the world serpent recognized atreus already right? So Odin knows he Is gonna die but in the mythology it says a new God or gods cant remember, so has it already happened or not or has it happened numerous times??

GodofWar,t3_c6bsre,The Ghost of Spardas faith theory (Spoilers included),"So I am sure at this point we have all played and completed the series as a whole at this point(or at very least the new game). What I wanna discuss is what Kratos' faith will be in the next game. 
As we know Kratos will for die at some point so Atreaus can ascend to become his best self. What some people might not know in regards to mythology is that Loki was always the one who basically killed Balder, started Ragnarok and was responsible for the end of the gods. Before Ragnarok there is the long winter which lasts about 3 years ( it states three long winters which I'm taking as years so they can age Loki a bit). After which we will see an older and more trained Atreaus, but one that is still learning the Spartan ways. 
Anyways I think before he meets his final faith Kratos will have to confess to killing his family(his daughter his wife, his sister and his father), and how he threw the world into the disrepair. How he is the ghost of Sparta, and he can never be the parent Atreus deserves. 
Kratos will die, handing the torch (blades) over to Loki and give us a final game with Loki looking for revenge against Odin who will have no doubt killed Kratos.",0,public,,1

So I bought a network pass through the PSN Store, but even after I download it, it still won't let me play the multiplayer tutorial.

GodofWar,t3_c61pom,Speculation/Predicting Major Plot Points of the Next Game,"Hi all, this is my first post!  
 (LARGE SPOILERS AHEAD)

  
So I've been finding out information about the original descriptions of Ragnarok and it appears that unless the key events of Ragnarok are adjusted, Kratos may not get to defeat as many of the main gods in the same way he did with the Greek pantheon. Specifically, Thor and Odin, two characters who seem to be the most likely choices for main antagonists of the next installment in the franchise, would die of causes other than combat with Kratos and Atreus.  
   
It is mentioned that Jormangandr and Thor will both kill each other in an epic battle, which is gonna be incredible to witness, and also super sad cause I love Jormangandr!  Also, as written, Odin is eaten by Fenrir, which means Kratos wouldn't be able to kill him, and Loki dies fighting Heimdall, whom we have yet to see in the franchise, though his horn is a collectible item. 

  
So what do you think? Will we see Ragnarok as written or will Kratos kill many gods who would have died otherwise in combat with other Norse gods? Will Atreus and possibly even Kratos die? Let me know your thoughts and I hope this gets some good conversation going.

Update: I think I might have sent the wrong message the way this was originally phrased. I am completely fine with Santa Monica Studios changing the mythos for the sake of story! If they totally change things up I think it would probably work in the game‚Äôs favor by giving more authority to Kratos and ultimately the player.",2,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_c5pn4v,Why is Sindri‚Äôs name ‚ÄúAtri/Atree‚Äù in Neil Gaimans book ‚ÄúNorse Mythology‚Äù?,"Another huge fanboy here who‚Äôs freakishly/ridiculously obsessed with Kratos and the entire God of War story! Played every game multiple times, read all the novels that have been written, bought all the digital comics, named my dog after him, many GoW toys around the house which my fianc√© hates, blah blah blah Blades of Chaos are the greatest weapons ever invented blah blah...

I wanted to ask this question about a year ago, but totally forgot until I was flying home from a trip last weekend and decided to re-listen to Neil Gaimans ‚ÄúNorse Mythology‚Äù book on my audiobook account. 

One of the first stories he talks about is concerning how Thor got his hammer (along with 5 other largely important items in the Norse mythology world), and the epic crafting battle between the Sons of Ivaldi vs Brok and ‚ÄúAtri/Atree‚Äù...not Brok and Sindri, as they were introduced to us in the new God of War game. I understand that Santa Monica isn‚Äôt following the mythology ‚Äúby the book‚Äù, but they also don‚Äôt do anything without meaning behind it...so when I noticed the name change in the book from the video game, it got me wondering. 

Is Sindri a character in Norse Mythology that we don‚Äôt know about yet? He wasn‚Äôt mentioned by Neil Gaiman anywhere in his stories, so it‚Äôs very odd to me that Santa Monica would change one of the most famous dwarf brothers in this mythology UNLESS there was a reason for this which will reveal itself to us in future games? Or maybe I‚Äôm looking too deep into this, but even though they‚Äôre playing with the storyline of Norse mythology, all the major players seem to be the same except for this Sindri/Atri name...

I know they combined Frey and Freyas character into being one person, they‚Äôve killed off characters who are supposed to survive Ragnarok, and the whole point of GoW games is that Kratos changes everything ‚Äúthat‚Äôs supposed to happen‚Äù...but this seems a little too dramatic of a name change to not be significant IMO.

- For best results it is advised to wait until you get Mimir's head before acquiring or completing any sidequests.

[ ] Mimir on Baldur
- Must fast travel back to Brok's Shop twice before activating the horn after reviving Mimir's head, will trigger after the discussion about Freya spitting in Mimir's face and Kratos tells him to speak of Baldur instead. The next Realm Between Realms travel should trigger it, will need to boat to any realm travel point on the map. Another conversation should trigger while in the boat heading towards the travel point that talks about the spitting again. Should trigger after that while in the Realm Between Realms before using the Horn in the A New Destination quest. Will likely not trigger after this quest, or as late as after The Magic Chisel.

[ ] On Magni and Modi
- Should trigger upon travelling the Realm Between Realms after triggering Mimir on Baldur. Should trigger in there before using the horn and finishing A New Destination Quest. Will not trigger after The Magic Chisel quest, and possibly after A New Destination.

[ ] Baldur and Odin
- Triggers at the next Realm Between Realms travel as early as before finishing A New Destination and as late as before entering Tyr's Temple in The Black Rune quest. Might need to listen to Mimir's stories in the boat first, they trigger if you wait a bit and then move the boat.

[ ] Odin and Jotunheim

GodofWar,t3_c5agxe,My Thoughts; A Retroactive Second Impression,"I don't do these for games I didn't want to like. If I know I won't like a game, I don't play it, and if I wanted to like a game but don't, then I end up even more gravely disappointed. Such is the case with God of War 2018. I've only ever done this style of impressions thread on Reddit twice before, with Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, and Devil May Cry 3. In Short, God of War has many merits; the great production values, cinematic presentation, top-notch animations outstanding character dynamics, rigorous, bass endorsed sound design, jaw-dropping environments, a scintillating color palette and a near endless creativity. Yet, all of this becomes null from the disjointed, dysfunctional gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the game Day 1, and beat it on Balanced. At the time, I liked it for a little while, but the game dragged on for me at the end and I became anxious to just complete it already. By the time the game ended, I was lukewarm on it and basically just forgot about it. Whilst looking for other games to play on my Ps4 because all I play on it are Sekiro and Resident Evil 4, with Furi thrown in there for good measure, I decided to give this game another try and see what it has to offer in terms of mechanics. I play all my games with headphones as close to my TV as comfortably possible, so I judge all my games from the same baseline.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I want to re-iterate that I wanted to like this game, and I have given it more than its fair share of chances. I also realize that while the gameplay may not meet my standard par, the more abstract features of the game are excellent and deserve their praise. However, I will be focusing solely on mechanics since I have a bias for pure gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

When we think of gameplay, most people think combat. The reason for this is because combat is the most involved form of gameplay, and as such, combat can quite literally make or break a game, even if everything else is fine. This is due to the nature of the interactivity, which is different from the passive nature of watching a bad movie. You can forgive a bad movie for wasting your precious, passive time, but bad combat is hard to forgive because it's interactive, and inherently more investing from the player. Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about my biggest gripe with the game:

&amp;#x200B;

**COMBAT**

&amp;#x200B;

Combat in this game is quite literally a mess, but why? Well, it's an amalgam of different gameplay facets that do not mesh well together. I played this second playthrough on New Game+ and on Challenge mode and the cracks make their name on this difficulty. I see many people say this game was inspired by Dark Souls, but was that really a good idea? Does everything have to be like Dark Souls? I like the Soulsborne games, but definitely not for their combat. Their combat meets par, and that's it, but it works because the entire game was designed with its mechanics in mind, just like how in Resident Evil 4 the camera is positioned more crudely than in GoW, but it functions because the enemies were designed to accomodate the camera. You never feel like you're fighting the systems in these games, but it always feels that way in GoW.

&amp;#x200B;

*Movement -* Kratos has weak mobility options in the game. He has a dodge and a roll, of which will be spammed pretty much constantly while avoiding fray in the battlefield. That's not a good implementation of side-step movement because it's not psychological game design. The feeling of a well-timed button press is unprecedented (in games, ofc), but in GoW, you will hammer buttons non-stop at the expense of no reward other than 'the encounter is done, pat yourself on the back'. I don't like this because the encounters themselves don't feel rewarding during battle, and as such, I only feel relief when the battle is over. The game loves to make the player 'feel' powerful from the cool animations and things like Spartan Rage, but these are just a strong coat of paint on a faulty core.

&amp;#x200B;

*Positioning -* Going back to Movement for a bit, Kratos also has a skill from with the back dodge R1 the sends him further back while throwing the axe. This can be considered a mobility option, but it doesn't work because positioning in this game is non-existent so BOTH you and the ENEMY have *move assist.* The enemy can start an animation from 6 meters away, and suddenly slide all the way to Kratos like the arena turned into a hockey ring. This completely negates the importance of positioning in action games and is another reason why this game needs a gameplay overhaul for the sequel.

&amp;#x200B;

*Camera -* I'm no stranger to bad camera angles as long as they're accommodated for the encounter designs. Do you know what GoW's accommodation is? Some arrows in the bottom of the screen. I cannot believe people defend this because this is quite literally **amateur** combat design. The developers themselves don't even know what they want the player to focus on.

&amp;#x200B;

*Identity -* This games lacks an identity of its own in the gameplay. You look at other great action games and one can immediately deduce what their purpose for existing is; it's quite philosophical. Bayonetta - Dodge offset; Devil May Cry - Combo Showcase; Vanquish - movement and cancels; Nioh - Stances and Ki Flux, etc.. GoW's purpose is.... to tell an interactive story. In terms of gampelay, it has no purpose. It feels like the devs got together and focused on what some trendy gameplay facets are popular in AAA gaming, decided to put those in their game and hope it would mesh, whilst keeping their cinematic vision in tact.

&amp;#x200B;

*Difficulty Design -* The faulty systems in place that create a disjointed combat. Let me provide an example of a game that is even harder, yet is still a replayable masterpiece that I've sunk 1000hrs into. This game is Ninja Gaiden 2 on Master Ninja difficulty. That game is a literal to-do list of how NOT to design difficulty, but even in the wake of that, I still find myself coming back to the game ON THAT DIFFICULTY over and over again. Why? Because the game's systems are so focused, so efficient, that I can't help but play it. In fact, I feel like the unfairness actually gives the game a certain charm, due to its unpredictability keeping the combat dynamic absolutely timeless. Even though that game has the balls to stack the deck against you every chance it can, it knows your deck is strong enough to handle it. GoW has no such deck. This is why the higher difficulties are an exercise in arduousness. I'm not giving NG2 a pass for being poorly designed difficulty, I'm giving it a pass because its systems are so good that it can afford to be unfair, and even benefit from it at times. GoW has no such luxury. GoW 2's higher difficulties need to focus on **FLOW** before anything else, as that is much more important for this kind of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

*Enemy Design -* in terms of visual designs, they are incredible, but in terms of function, they all behave the same. They are all tackled so similarly, that it becomes a formality. Not to mention the lack of variety in the enemy designs. I don't mind a lack of variety as long as the A.I. demonstrate the qualities necessary in present to carry the lack of variety, but they don't. Revenants are the one enemy in the game that dared to do something different, and people seem to hate them. Goes to show that devs just can't win sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, this game gets many things right. Its animations are stellar, the world design and environments are unmatched, the color palette is vibrant, sound design is phenomenal, character dynamics are interesting, the dialogue is outstanding (it's a SCRIPT!), and many, many more great things about the game. Unfortunately, for someone like me who values gameplay above everything, I could not get into this game even though I really wanted to. The disjointed mish-mash of different, contradicting ideas end up creating a mess that I have to clean. It seems people forgive these flaws simply because the coat of paint is so strong, it practically carries the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the sequel improves on the gameplay, because this series can truly be more than just a great script and great environments, it can be a **great game, too,** and that's what I wish to see for the next installment.",1,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_c53uh4,Recommended difficulty for nearing the end of the story and valkyries,"Not sure if I'm actually nearing the end, but it sure feels like it. Spoilers tag just in case. I've just brought the Jotunheim tower back from the ""realm between realms.""

Basically, I've struggled with finding a comfortable but fun difficulty the entire time throughout the game. I started off on challenge mode, and I quickly got tired of being two-shotted by heavy draugr and revenants while also having to pay attention to the many smaller enemies running around, so I lowered it to balanced mode a little while after lowering the water level the first time. Since then, it's just felt way too easy. I had trouble with that one valkyrie that constantly flies up in the air and stomps your face in, but other than that I don't think I've died a single time. I did change to ""give me a story"" mode so I could farm muspelheim and niflheim, but as soon as I finished upgrading their respective armors I went back up to balanced mode, only to find that the game is even easier than before since I have pretty much maxed level gear (for now, at least). So I'm thinking of moving back up to challenge mode, but at the same time I dread those early game memories of dying countless times just to get through that one draugr gauntlet as soon as you fall through the bridge after leaving home.

Advice? Tips? What are the endgame bosses like? (Without spoilers) I know the final valkyrie is supposed to be hell, but hard boss fights are fun to me. 

I stop enjoying myself when I have to juggle 1-2 big guys capable of 2-shotting me along with some smaller enemies and a few others chucking fireballs at me. That's more obnoxious and unbearable than it is fun, imo.

Anyhow, what're your story and gameplay predictions? I think for one thing that Odin will be teased and it'll be a terrifying sequence. It'd be scary because we only see things from Kratos and Atreus' perspective. So we know about Odin only though stories, and he's a sadistic and powerful god from what's been told. Imagine if he pops up unexpectedly and is very taunting and intimidating. And Kratos and Atreus have to escape from him or something. I think that'd be great. Also Mimir is totally getting a new body.

GoW was never Shakespeare but it wasnt Transformers either.  I've loved the GoW series since 2005 and don't care for when people say that the series was just mindless violence, but GoW (2018) felt like a natural and earned progression of Kratos' character.

-When you toss Mimir's head to Brok before walking up the stairs to Jotunheim, Kratos has the slightest smirk on his face in knowing he's somewhat torturing Mimir. 

-Whenever there's a pivotal moment of dialogue between two characters (Kratos and Freya primarily), there's something between them that highlights the moment. When Freya tells Kratos she knows he's a god, Atreus is trying to pick herbs up to heal Hildisvini. Between them when they talk before the final battle with Baldur is Thamur's bracelet (with a word I can't translate) and that highlights something between the scene. But I have zero clue what it is or what it means.

-When Freya gives Kratos the travel rune to Helheim, the camera closes in on her face. It looks like her face is being sucked dry. Almost sickly. Clearly throughout the game she's getting darker tattoos on her maybe through her use of magic. Her fingertips, her arms and shoulders. But her face looking like it was draining was important.

-In a scroll, while looking for Andvari's hammer, he talks about his Soul Eater project. Apparently Surtr has Soul Eaters in his personal use, brought to them by his own personal request. And Andvari is terrified at what Surtr may be using them for.

-Early in the game, Atreus yells at Kratos asking why a fire troll would burn mother's garden. We haven't seen many fire trolls in the game but APPARENTLY Faye and the trolls knew each other. Barlog mentioned that they wanted the trolls to have their own fleshed out lore but time and space constraints didn't allow it. Odin and Tyr had made an arrangement between each other and apparently the trolls got lost in the mix (this is by Barlog's admission). It ended with almost the pure genocide of the troll tribes. Which explains why their first instinct is to attack. Because fuck everyone.

-Athena is a figment of Kratos's imagination. I'd call it PTSD but that's a rather loaded term. Mimir says ""well I'm pretty sure you weren't talking to me back there. Anything you'd like to get off your chest, brother?"" Which I think is the team's way if saying ""we're gonna deal with his past as much as we need to"". I take it to mean Athena isn't going to play an equivalent role in Norse myths as she did in Greek myths. 

-A few of the giants in Jotunheim have their heads bashed in. There's dried blood on the mountains they're leaning against.

-I highly doubt Freya will be a villain in the next game. I can't imagine Odin will give her back her wings. If anything that could backfire on him when she figures out that Odin is the mind behind all of the mess she's been through. 

-When you go to the Jotunheim realm tower in the realm between realms, there's no archaic runes etched on the braziers. Once the tower reappears, there's runes. No idea why the switch occurs though.

-When you max out the axe, you get an achievement that says ""Worthy"". We know the team leaves Marvel references all over the game. The Infinity Gauntlet is somewhat in the game (the game's take on it at least). So is this the biggest hint that we'll be able to pick up Mjolnir in the next game?",280,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_c4hfwj,chest bug (minor spoiler to some people but not really),"I've read a bunch of forums on this, including here on reddit, and I've done a lot of googling, but I haven't found a conclusive answer to this.

My runs consist of two loops. One to defeat enemies, unlock nornir chests, and open wooden chests and coffins, and one to open legendary and nornir chests. My second run always has exactly one legendary chest already open. By this I mean I didn't open it on my first run. It was closed the last time I saw it after defeating the surrounding enemies and continuing the loop, but when I come back to it on the second loop, it's already open. Every time, without fail, there's always an open chest on my second loop, always in the ""first base"" section of the map.

What causes this? I've tried refreshing the area, saving and quitting, closing and restarting the application. So what gives? Anyone know anything about this? I know it's just one chest, but it's bugging me.

GodofWar,t3_c4b45k,Question About Armor Levels,"Apologies if this has been asked before, but google turned up nothing, so here goes!

I am in the endgame now, completed muspelheim part one and working my way through niflheim, and when I looked at the armors I can craft from each place, I realized the muspel armor was level 4, with much worse stats than the level 7 niflheim armor. 

I assume this is because I actually visited muspelheim much earlier in the game, so the armor i scaled to how powerful I was. It's still legendary armor that is very expensive to get and has cool effects, but the stats are basically useless compared to the armor I have available now. 

Is there any way to fix this? I haven't tried upgrading it, but it seems to me upgrading always only increases the stats of armor by twos or fours.

GodofWar,t3_c1zr6s,Not having internet at my new house made me fully appreciate how amazing God of War is.,"I've always been a fan of the series. Played the 3 main games, one of the PSP games (where the main antagonist is Persephone), subscribed to PS Now just to play Ascension, and got the new one the day it came out. However, on my first playthrough,  I didn't get all the extras, such as Odin's ravens,  didn't beat the Valkyrie Queen, etc. I mainly played the main story due to my friends hounding me to get back to playing Blackout with them. Now that I don't have internet at my new house, I sat down and played God of War again. And this time around, I'm 5 ravens away from platinum. I finally beat the Valkyrie queen, and I overall enjoyed gaming so much more now that I'm offline. I was thinking about getting internet hooked up, but nah, online kinda ruins the fun in gaming for me. I enjoy single player story games so much more. Once I beat the game again, I'm super psyched to play it in NG+ from what I read about it. Next, I'll play Horizon Zero Dawn again and then do the Frozen Wilds DLC that I bought and downloaded before I moved. Then, its NG+ for that game as well.

GodofWar,t3_c22ss8,More theories about Atreus: he's a time traveler,"I'll **try** to be brief. Mimir said that Ragnarok ""already happened in the future"", and Jormungandr came back to the past as a result of his fight with Thor, and coming from the future explains why he recognized Atreus. If we follow Norse mythology, we should know that the World Serpent is Loki's son, and maybe that's why Jormungandr felt that Atreus looked so familiar. So, if Loki is Jormungandr's father in the game (cuz that could be modified as GoW games tend to change some things to make a better story), that would mean, of course, that for Ragnarok to happen Atreus should be able to reproduce, then have children, so Thor can finally fight Jormungandr. 

Another interesting fact is that, after Norse mythology, Hela is Loki's daughter too, and she already reigns Helheim in GoW 4. So, we have two possibilities: GoW games will modify some facts about Loki's children so that Hela, Jormungandr (and maybe Fenrir later)  appearances make sense, OR JORMUNGANDR IS NOT THE ONLY TIME TRAVELER AFTER RAGNAROK, LOKI ALSO CAME BACK TO THE PAST, to get his revenge, and that's why all the Norse gods hate Loki so much, he's portrayed as the God of Mischief because he's always causing trouble to the gods, as he hates them. The reason of why Atreus and Kratos don't know about Loki (who is actually ""Future Atreus"" that came back to the past) is because he's always changing his form, transforming into something else, and some gods even don't know what Loki's real form is. Jormungandr does, cuz Loki is his father. 

What do you think?

GodofWar,t3_c1zd3s,[Discussion] What is the max possible level I can reach before starting new game +?,"Basically the title of the discussion.

What equipment, talismans, and rune skills do I need to get to level 8 or 9?  

Also, I keep dying against Sigrun and at most can get her to half health. Can't, or honestly don't really know what to do while waiting for my skills to recharge (cooldown stat is pretty high but none of my armor is fully upgraded yet) and I struggle to dodge and figure out what moves to block. My strategy for all the other Valkyries was just spamming skills and taking advantage of full rage after reviving from death, but that isn't working for this fight due to her durability. Afraid to level up though because I heard she gets scaled up based on your level.

I'm currently on normal difficulty and the last guide I read recommended switching to give me a story difficulty....but not sure if I want to do that yet, or if it will make a difference.

Any advice on builds and skills for this fight?

Also, heard you can get killed in three hits in new game + even with fully upgraded armor from first playthrough. Is that for all difficulties?

Best armor in new game +? ( I'm not the best at avoiding and dodging. I'm more attack focused. Want to know what armor and play style I should focus on once I do new game +)

GodofWar,t3_c1xfnn,I think GOW5 might be like Logan...,"In the movie Logan, Wolverine is old and past his prime. Kratos is old but not past his prime, it‚Äôs been stated by Cory Barlog that he‚Äôs just as strong. Both Logan and Kratos have mellowed out to an extent in their old age and are even protecting young children. Following along? Good. So now that we established that, let‚Äôs get into it. In the movie, X-24 is a young clone of Logan. Way more aggressive and constant rage. His own worst enemy is himself and in both instances X-24 destroys him. Only to be saved by Laura (X-23) with an adamantium bullet. As I  said in a post a few weeks ago that blew up on here, Thor is a mirror of Kratos. He is who Kratos would‚Äôve been had he stayed loyal to the Olympians and was still full rage mode. Thor I think will very much over power Kratos due to his constant rage and try to even kidnap Atreus for revenge against him for killing his sons. X-24 also tried to kidnap Laura during the movie. I think we will fight Thor and in both instances or at least when we kill him, Atreus will be the one to save Kratos somehow or at least even the odds. He broke Baldurs curse in GOW4 and maybe he‚Äôll remove Thor‚Äôs belt that doubles his strength in 5 (if we‚Äôre going by mythology and assume he has his belt in it). Thor is totally gonna be X-24/ Young Kratos. Rage all the time and a mirror of who Kratos used to be.",4,public,,1

This being said, is it worth it to play the hardest difficulty? Are there things you get for doing so? I‚Äôve tried the first portion of the game on this difficulty and holy shit, I don‚Äôt know if I can do it.

Any opinions on this problem would be greatly appreciated.",3,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_c102br,The next God of War game - everything we know,"\- Its production will not take as long as its predecessor. God of War 2018 refined the series in many ways. Now that a foundation has been established for a new series, it is one that Sony Santa Monica can safely rely on. Cory Barlog has said as much in an interview with Kotaku.

\- It is the next part in a new series. Cory has mentioned he has ideas for five more games, in the same interview mentioned above. Whether or not something of this longevity happens is unknown. It's possible this will end up being a trilogy, as has also been said.

\- It will be entirely set in Norse mythology, as confirmed by Sony Santa Monica's communications director Aaron Kaufman.

\- Cory Barlog may not direct the upcoming title, but has stated he would still be involved in the game's development to ensure success.

\- Artist Nate Stephens has indicated that the fight against Thor will be much longer and much bigger.

\- Kratos won't die. At least, not permanently. Cory Barlog has mentioned that without him, it is not a proper God of War story.

That's all the official stuff that I could find. Please add something if I missed it!",407,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_c0rc1v,New player.. questionable gameplay,"Hey,

So, I'm in fairly early, but I just wanna raise a few grievances with some of the gameplay as I feel it's just partly badly designed but feel free to teach me some top tips.

Revenants feel extremely bad to fight. Lots of teleporting, which isn't too bad, but then they are just brown blobs, in brown environments which makes them really hard to telegraph react. Added on to that their animations are really poor. Thier attacks look very similar to their stagger animations that it's hard to tell when they're taking damage or when they are swinging at you making them pretty unfair and unfun to fight. Throw in that you also tend to play Vs two of them and they run away to corner so you will always have your back to one throwing homing missiles at you it feels particular unfair.

Ancients, so these guys are visually cool and rewarding to fight. But man some of their attacks feel VERY unfair. 
The explosion missiles are by far their best designed attack, gives you time to attack if you dodge with good timing, but also pose a very serious threat.
However the laser that goes to your feet is pretty damn stupid. It's very fast, instantly does damage, and tracks you perfectly. This attack is very very badly designed imo. Especially because this is supposed to be the one time you hit them back, but you can't because you need to dodge a very fast tracking high damaging ability.
Combine this with the fact that it has the exact same starting animation as the missiles you either lose damage on the missiles expecting a laser do are running around, or you expect missiles and take damage from the laser. 
You can easily fix this by adding a charging animation to the laser so you can prepare for a moment.

Finally another weakness of the game is it's camera. It feels like a really narrow view, so you can very often get hit from behind, throw in a projectile, a speedy fireboi enemy, and you take damage before you can really react. Feels kinda unfair.

Please let me know if I'm wrong though! And I do love the combat it's just these few niggles that are really pressing me.",0,public,,1

I noticed something strange in Tyr's temple (in the room where you get the black rune). If you climb the wall and jump down you land close to a pillar that has an arrow pointing upwards. Higher up there's one pointing down, and then up again.

Now the weird thing: if I stand in front of that pillar and press down two times to turn around quickly, I hear a strange noise. I hear the same noise if I stand facing away from the pillar and then move my character or just look back around without using the down key (see included video) .

It reminds me of the gong you hear when getting the secret 'forbidden grip of the ages'. It also made a noise when you made a mistake I think.

So is there a secret here that I'm missing? Is there a sequence you have to follow that I can't find out? Has anyone else noticed this and maybe gotten any further?

GodofWar,t3_c00r0d,The one scene that bothers me in GoW 4 (SPOILERS),"When Kratos comes face-to-face with Baldur, for the second time, Baldur impales Kratos with a piece of stone. This gives Kratos immense amount of pain and you can see Kratos holding the area where he was impaled. Even when Atreus pushes Kratos away, Kratos goes back to holding the punctured area because it hurts. However, there is no hole or blood and moments later, he acts as if nothing happened and he goes to fight Baldur. This was an in-cutscene wound that Kratos received so shouldn't it have been more prominent? In previous installments, Kratos has been hurt and the gameplay acknowledges this. For example, in Ghost of Sparta, Deimos punches Kratos into a bloody mess. Kratos doesn't pick himself up right away to sprint and fight Thanatos. He struggles to get his posture and slowly walks away from his blood pool.

I'm not saying Kratos should have been out for the count, due to his wound, I'm saying there should have been a little more time to acknowledge it. The impaling served little purpose since Kratos basically shrugged it off. Kratos is durable, however, he's not invincible. He was even killed by Ares, in a similar fashion, by being impaled by stone (a much bigger piece, mind you). This particular scene just stood out to me.",295,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bzm46b,Kratos' idiolect,"I haven't seen this confirmed by Santa Monica and haven't seen it discussed, but I got the sense that the way Kratos speaks in the Norse game isn't just him being a gruff man, it's reflective of his lack of familiarity with the old Norse language. From ""Boy!"" and ""Woman!"" and ""Head!"" to ""do not speak again"" and ""it was her wish, and it was time"" and ""the Axe did not return"" and ""you would not listen"" and ""LEAVE MY HOME"", Kratos not only is a man of fewer words than he was in the previous games but he uses certain words in an odd way and in sentences his words are generally very emphatic and weighty. Every other character displays a much more casual and flowy idiolect, and there are even anachronisms like Atreus saying ""duh"" 

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but my parents had to learn English and I noticed some similarities in their and Kratos' usage of it. If I'm right, it's just another display of the attention to detail and care that went into this game 

Btw if it wasn't obvious, you can surmise that the whole game they're conversing in Old Norse from their ability to communicate with other characters  and then it's brought to attention when Atreus tries to teach Kratos how to read Old Norse because he only knows how to speak it",495,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_bztjg6,Theory about the mural and Kratos‚Äô fate,"So by now we know kratos has already died before and got back from Greek mythology‚Äôs hell without that much trouble. If the mural‚Äôs painting is correct kratos dies, but what happens to those who die in Nordic mythology you may ask. Well if they died a warriors dead like kratos most likely would, a Valkyrie takes them to Valhalla, and we know at least one important Valkyrie. So get this, kratos could die fighting Thor and maybe freya takes him to Valhalla so she can get her revenge, or perhaps he dies fighting freya and afterwards she takes him there maybe regretting killing him, or maybe she was already going there idk. Anyways kratos now is in Valhalla and can get to Odin.



Also, Valhalla‚Äôs description is that it‚Äôs heaven and the warriors are happy to be there fighting 24/7 basically. I imagine Santa Monica can spin this idea pretty well and show that it‚Äôs actually torturous to be there and only Odin really likes it or something",16,public,Spoilers,1

GodofWar,t3_bzjnej,God of War backstory questions!,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YETCT15X4gE

I have the following questions about the above video, in my desperate search to learn more about the God of War franchise...

I‚Äôve put a time marker for the video linked by each question as it relates to the specific part of the video.

5:00 - how did Kratos get God-like powers to begin with if he was just a man that made an oath to Ares?

5:00 - how can queen of underworld reunite Kratos with his fallen daughter? Is this god reviving the daughter?

5:30 - how can Kratos go up against Atlas and the queen of underworld if he gave his god-like powers up to see his daughter?

5:48 - why does Atlas hold the world on his shoulders? I know he‚Äôs chained in there but can‚Äôt he still drop it as he and queen of underworld originally planned?

5:53 - why does Kratos commit himself to losing his memory again? Did the option of seeing his daughter (revived or otherwise) get taken away from him when the queen of underworld died?

9:30 - ‚Äúthe gods will pay for this‚Äù is Kratos referring to the god of death killing his brother? Or just the general shit they‚Äôve been throwing his way?

10:50 - why was Kratos rescued by Gia and why did he help Kratos her revenge?

11:00 - again, how can Kratos have so much power if he put it all in the blade of Olympus before Zeus killed him? Is he just less powerful but still powerful enough as a mortal to defeat this foes on the island of creation?

11:45 - why do the titans wish to help defeat Olympus and the gods? I‚Äôm guessing Kratos could not beat Zeus after accidentally killing Athena, which is why he has to gather an army of titans?

12:30 - why does pandora want to sacrifice herself to extinguish the flame of Olympus?

GodofWar,t3_bzi2t2,Could Loki Be The Sequel's Villain?,"So, we all know that Atreus grows up to become Loki and something time travel happens, he gets sent to the past, the World Serpent gets sent to the past and Fenrir is born. For some reason, Odin releases Fenrir's sons and they bring Kratos to Midgard. Now, I'm not the most educated on Norse mythology aside from the book Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman, which was a while ago, so I'll be honest, I'm very likely wrong about some of this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

But, essentially, after the murder of Baldur by Hodr, Loki humiliates the Aesir to such a degree at a dinner that even Odin cannot stop him. Thor comes in and Loki gets scared and shuts the fuck up. Loki is soon thereafter taken by the Aesir to a cave deep within the Earth with his wife Sigyn and their two sons. One son is transformed into a werewolf and made to kill the other son, whose guts are then used to chain a despondent Loki. A snake is positioned to drip venom into Loki's eyes for all eternity, with Sigyn collecting the venom in a bowl and dumping it when it gets full. When she dumps it, the snake drips so hard that Loki goes woo on a bitch and tries to escape his bonds, his strength triggering earthquakes. Eventually, Loki breaks free with such force that Ragnarok begins. He goes to Hel and has his daughter Hela lead the legions of the dead out against the Aesir, his son Fenrir is freed and the end of the Gods begins.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what if the villain in the second game isn't Thor, isn't Odin, but it's Loki? We know that Ragnarok is coming and Odin knows how he dies. So what if he let Fenrir's sons drag Kratos to Midgard to change the timeline, bring him there in a different manner than he would have come and ultimately change the order of things. Ragnarok happens sooner, Loki breaks free and Kratos takes Heimdall's place against him. What if that's the crux of Odin's trickery: have Kratos kill his own son to present him with a choice:

&amp;#x200B;

1. To ensure that Odin is killed, allow Atreus to live his life as it would has gone down in the timeline. Let him go back in time, become blood brother to the Gods by exchanging blood with Odin, father the beasts and eventually destroy the world as we know it only to get killed by his own father in the end.
2. Change Atreus' fate at the cost of Odin no longer being bound by Ragnarok and surviving to continue his hustle, his grand trickery in pursuit of knowledge, once more, this time Jinder unhindered.

GodofWar,t3_bz7rlm,"Hey guys, I need your help. I just started GMGOW, and it's kicking my teeth in","This is going to be a very lengthy post, it's my first time posting here and I want you all to understand where I'm coming from when I share certain opinions below.

So a few days ago, I finally beat my first playthrough of Sekiro. It was an amazing game, with an absolutely stellar finish with the final boss being one of the hardest and best designed bosses in gaming (imo). When I finally beat it after probably 50 tries, I was drunk on the challenge it presented and decided I should pick up my absolute favorite game of the last few years, and beat it on the hardest difficulty, God of War.

Now, I knew this was going to be a challenge. I've seen all your posts about how the first set of draugr kicked your asses and made you quickly adapt to how GMGOW needed to be played, which is to say, relentlessly. And I did exactly that, and it was STILL a challenge, but I loved it, and was ready for more

At least that's what I thought

As I continued through the gruelling combat and became a god (get it?) at switching strategies to suit the situation and making sure I kept the enemy where I wanted them and keeping them from buffing, I started to figure it out. And it felt really good.

And then Atreus broke that dumb wooden bridge, and suddenly I felt like I was playing a different game. I understand that GMGOW is supposed to be INSANELY difficult, that's what I wanted after all, but this fight just seemed unfair. Enemies everywhere that can quickly surround you in an area that feels way too small for the number there are, and two fire throwing draugr above you that take 4 or 5 hits with the thrown axe to take down, AND a fight with three heavies and more standard draugr, I just had this sinking feeling. I died at least several dozen times before I finally got it, and when I did, I didn't feel like I had won the battle because I got better or overcame the challenge, I felt like I had just gotten lucky. But you know what hey, I beat it, so its time to move on to the next battle.

And now, I'm stuck again, in that little area right after the second Apple, where the fight starts with a Revenant and two heavy draugr. And guys, I just can't do it.

I have gotten my parry times down perfectly (Sekiro helped a lot with that), I am always ready to dodge attacks from the side or behind, and I am relentless in my attacks, doing the best I can to never let my enemies catch a breath. And yet, I die anyway, because as more enemies join the fray, it just seems impossible to manage all of it.

I've heard from friends and from other posts that it gets easier once you can upgrade your equipment and have more skills, since they give you more tools to deal with the onslaught, and you can customize Kratos to fit your playstyle. But for right now, I just don't see how I'm going to get past it, and it has caused me to have something I never expected to have in this game: a complaint.

Now, before I go on, I want to make it clear that I absolutely ADORE this game. Its right up there with the greatest games of all time, and I will always remember it fondly. But here's my issue, and to illustrate it, I'm going to go back to Sekiro since its so fresh in my mind (keeping it spoiler free of course).

The final boss of Sekiro is an absolute masterpiece, and it's because of its brilliant design. It is so unbelievably difficult, but at no point do you feel it's unfair. Every time I died, it was because I screwed up, I made a mistake, and I got punished for it. It was firm, but fair, so to speak.

This fight in GMGOW doesn't feel that way. You are at such a disadvantage in almost every way, with enemies being able to buff themselves in almost no time at all, not being able to stagger most enemies before they even buff at all, and just the sheer number of them, it just doesn't seem reasonable, and to me it just isn't that much fun. In fact, if I'm being a hundred percent honest, those design choices seem kind of lazy, just a cop out way to make the combat incredibly difficult without actually putting in that much extra effort.

Now, I know a lot of you are probably going for that downvote button right now, and I get it. Especially since a lot of you HAVE overcome this challenge and might see it differently, but as of right now, I just don't understand it. Which, of course, is why I'm here.
 
I've been lurking on this page for a long time now, and I can honestly say it's one of the best communities on Reddit. You guys are so kind and supportive, and obviously love this game as much if not more than I do, and I need your help. Do you guys have any tips to help me get through this? Is there maybe something I'm missing here that is making this more difficult than it should? Or is this just another case of a scrub who needs to ""git gud""?

And more importantly, I want to know if any of you feel the same way as I do about the difficulty at the beginning of this game. I feel like we all love this game so much that at times we will look at it with rose tinted glasses and ignore certain flaws that it has, but EVERY game has flaws, no video game is perfect, at least in my opinion. Is there anyone else who just felt like this opening section was unfair and frustrating for the player? Do any of you feel like this could've been done in a better way, like say keeping it easier until you can upgrade Kratos, THEN ramping up the difficulty? If you've made it this far into the post, I'm sure you'll have opinions of your own you want to share, and I would love to get a discussion with y'all going. Thank you for taking the time to read my first post, and for any advice or thoughts you guys can give",4,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bz7sh5,More GoW talk,"Watching a GoW 2 walkthrough and I noticed a similarity to GoW 2018, maybe 2. The 1st was how Kratos kills the smaller minotaur, he headbutts them to the ground, and when he's about to shank them through the mouth, they grab his arms leading to a struggle, then he breaks free and shanks them anyway. The similarity is how he kills the bridge keeper of helheim, theres a struggle, then he breaks the pillar with the blades before shanking him through the face.

Now this next one is pure assumption, in GoW 2 we are introduced to the fates. They are  also referenced in the beginning of GoW 2018, the norns, anyone think we will see them in the sequel?

Another question I have, is how Kratos might tie into Egyptian Mythology, racked my brain for a bit and couldn't even come close to coming up with ideas... unless this could be a thanos style, big bad type thing, who ends up being an Egyptian God to end the franchise? Make sense?

GodofWar,t3_bzd7ss,God of War Overrated?,"I didnt comment anything on GoW all this time that i didnt play it but i kept reading that its awesome, the best game of the year and a masterpiece and that it deserves over 10 rating etc. I played RDR2 first and AC Odyssey and now I'm playing GoW and i want to comment on this.

No, this game isnt that good. I dont understand why its so overrated and people say its a masterpiece. Imo both RDR2 and AC Odyssey are better games. Also I even prefer GoW 3 over this. Dont get me wrong, its a decent game and pleasurable to play. And the fact that its  kratos makes it even  cooler for us that we loved the old GoW games but it doesnt deserve GOTY over the other 2 games i mentioned.

Its strongest point is the graphics, its gorgeous, absolutely stunning and also because of the camera placement it gives you a cinematic feeling throughout the whole game but :

1. It has an average story
2. The camera might add to the looks but it retracks from the gameplay, you need to ""fight"" it during combat because you can see only infront of you.
3. The combat is a Dark souls and Hack &amp; slash mix type of combat which is decent but  as a DS veteran i would say its worse than DS/AC origins -odyssey. Plus you are fighting the camera too and its ""cheaper"" you just stunlock the easy enemies to death or if the big ones swarm you its a pain in the ass.
4. Unbalanced enemies and more unbalanced enemy encounters because of backtracking. Backtracking is horrible in every game. No gamer ever liked it and dont act like you enjoy it now because you're playing GoW. Also how  does it make sense that Kratos dies in 3 hits from a draugr while he needs to hit it 15 times to kill it? It makes Kratos seem weak as fuck. Also you meet simple lame enemies so strong that they will kill you in 1 hit, that shouldnt have been possible, its ridiculous. I fought &gt;!Baldur!&lt; and it seems he was 1000 times weaker than a draugr.
5. Horrible movement restriction. Yes it has it, its an open world game filled with invisible walls. You can only go where the game wants you to go. There are spots in the game with items for example that I as a normal human being would be able to  reach easily but no, Kratos cant go jump from his boat to that shore, he has to take the looong way around because  there simply isnt a ""dock"" there. Or he cant climb to that rock its  too ""tall"" for a dwarf. They totally failed in the idea of an open world because of this.
6. Lack of weapon variety
7. Lack of miniboss variety
8. Repetitive puzzles

I'm not just bashing the game like its crap, its a good game. I've played tons and tons of games over the years and this is one of the better ones but its so overrated and it got GOTY while it didnt deserve it in my opinion so i wanted to say the flaws I saw while playing. And i havent finished it yet, I just hope i wont find more negatives along the way.

My rating of the game so far would be an 8/10 and thats probably because im a Kratos fan, if it was just a different game i dont know about, it could have been 7.  And the GOTY choice between AC odyssey and RDR2 is hard.",0,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_bytjv4,Can Kratos die from gunshot wounds?,"Some people say that kratos can be easily penetrated or stabbed. But if i rmb correctly, he‚Äôs only been stabbed by gods with immense strength, a normal human might not be strong enough to stab through his skin. So are bullets powerful enough to penetrate him?

GodofWar,t3_byskip,Why the Aesir Gods might be harder for Kratos than the Olympians....,"As we know, the Olympians were dicks. Manipulating and ruling over mortals. Zeus was always looking to bed mortals and just straight up control them. They manipulated Kratos to do their bidding but never sought his death until he opened Pandora‚Äôs Box and started destroying towns. Athena was always helpful even though she secretly used Kratos for power. Zeus was powerful as king but he never was very bloodthirsty. He was only trying to protect Olympus but he did turn on Kratos which is a no no. Ares was a big challenge, loving war and was very violent. He‚Äôs probably the closest to an Aesir God. All Aesir Gods are part War Gods. They all have a love of fighting. The Olympians do not, they all love to well... ‚Äúlove‚Äù. Zeus just wanted to rule over mortals and be in power. That‚Äôs it.  Odin wants all knowledge of everything and he will kill anyone who gets in his way. Thor is the biggest butchering bastard in the nine realms and sounds like he might be like how Kratos used to be (I did a post on that recently). Even Valhalla is designed for warriors who die to fight and drink and bang until Ragnarok, that is their heaven. In Greece we had the Elysian Fields, a peaceful place to just enjoy life.  Different cultures will come into play here. Kratos is no longer 100% monster mode, and I think he will need to bring it back to fight a whole Pantheon, the Aesir, where every one of them is essentially a war god.",7,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bypw8g,[Spoiler] how did kratos get here?,"So. Obviously in the end of kratos' greek mythology phase he put an end to his life by using the blade that could slay TITANS with ease. That should have been it. He blade of Olympus is supposed to be the end of life. Used to ""kill"" mortal kratos. Helped kill his father. Helped slay legions of the undead. But for some reason it didnt kill kratos. After all the gods lay dead. Including himself. Somehow kratos recovered from the massive self inflicted god sword wound. Patch himself up. Somehow dip into norse mythology and start a family without anyone questioning ""hey whats up with that massive scar that nearly goes all the way across your body?"" So my question is. HOW. How could kratos recover from the blade if Olympus and make a strong and fast enough recovery to begin a family probably shorty after. He massacred the greeks.

This game transitions from cut scene to gameplay in such a seamless manner and I have never seen any other major AAA game do that. I am also digging the combat system.

GodofWar,t3_bynm1f,Possible subjects of interest for a possible sequel.,"A few things I wanted to share as I have studied Norse mythology more. Thought these could be a good conversation starter as we hope and look forward to a sequel!

1. In the prose Edda written by Snorri Sturluson, the Aesir gods came from the city of Troy.
2. There is evidence that supports in early Norse myth, Tyr was in fact the head of the Norse pantheon. Not Odin.
3. From an archetypal stand point, giants were not all large, oversized humanoids. They were people who were outside the ‚Äútribe‚Äù, people who were different. (I believe Mimir made some sort of comment about this soon after Kratos takes his head).
4. This may or may not mean anything, but I find interesting. Ginnungagap, which is a gaping void (could be seen as chaos) brought about the creation of the Norse cosmos/universe by the fire and ice from Niflheim and Muspelheim merging. Chaos from an archetypal stand point is seen as raw potential for either creation or destruction. I think it is kind of funny that Kratos‚Äô main weapons are both Fire and Ice.",3,public,Spoilers,1
GodofWar,t3_byk8mf,I‚Äôve restarted the game in Hard mode,"After beating the Valkyrie Queen and everything in normal, I felt pretty good about myself and I‚Äôve tried out hard now.

I don‚Äôt usually play games in hard but I just really liked God of War and I didn‚Äôt want to just do the same play through.

What I‚Äôm getting at is that I‚Äôm not so into getting a challenge from a game and I‚Äôm doing this mostly to explore this world again but from a sightly different perspective. But then I saw a nightmare fuse with a level 1 druag and the fusion proceeded to One shot me.

I know half the fun of the game is discovering your own play style but I get very easily discouraged from grinding that goes nowhere and I only got through the Valkyrie Queen because she was literally the last thing in the game.

GodofWar,t3_byea0f,"Call me crazy but I expect the next game around mid 2020, heres why","So heres my reasoning:

First of all, I know most people expect it to be for the PS5, and it makes sense, but I think that due to the nature of the game and how it was built, that they can pull it off much earlier, and make it the last PS4 exclusive. They could always milk a ""remastered"" version on the ps5 anyway

-On the Raising Keatos documentary, right after the E3 reveal section, they talk about how they were scared that it took them too long to proddice the trailer, the guy says ""it took us 2 years to produce those 10 minutes, and we have like a year and half to do 30 hours of game, and we dont know if thats humanely possible. You can also see by the end that they had to turn the game in by January 2018. So it took them less than 2 years to go from the trailer to the final product.

-Technically speaking, their engine is already optimized for stuff like the one-shot camera, realm traveling, fast travel, how Atreus works, how the Axe works, etc.

-And assets like the lake of nine and Tyr's temple, will most definetly make a return, so other than some visual updates (and maybe some paths blocked by snow or something), I doubt they need to spend a lot of time on it.

-While we obviously should expect new enemies, the basic ones like draugrs and hel walkers, wolves, wolverns, etc, will make a return, so theres not much to polish there.

-Sunny Suljic is at that point where he is growing up by the day, if they want him to fit the timeline, they should be doing his stuff by now.

-Most importantly, we know that the game had a very limited budget and lots of doubts from SM's bosses. That wont be the case here, after the success of the first one, Im certain that SM will get a much bigger budget and a lot of support from Sony, and I dont see them wanting to delay it till the Ps5 is out.

-All this Ragnarok is Coming teasing from twitter and the ps4 theme, would be kinda weird if the game was still 2-3 years away.


So, I dont find it impossible for it to be out mid 2020, which would be about 2 and a half years after they finished the first one, which they made in less than 2 years once they had the engine optimized for the reveal.",14,public,,1

Those dark elves in the room you put the unity stone really screwed me up, probably tied with the double traveler encounter for the hardest fight in the game for me.

The combat is so fast and you can really only get hit once. The margin for error is very slim. Its very rewarding however because it forces you to literally use every single tool you have unlocked to that point ON TOP of thinking critically on how to dispatch each mob. While I enjoy this challenge I'm no sure how far I will go in the end. Perhaps after unlocking armor, more skills, and runic attacks will make mob kills easier. Right now even fighting three enemies is hard.

**EDIT** You guys are so encouraging. Thank you. I will definitely stick with it. I've played my fair share of difficult action-oriented third person games. God of Boi just happens to be one of the most current impressive ones on console. I feel the devs designed a truly great system here. Even though you go down quick it never feels 100% impossible.

And so i did expecting to be entertained for like an hour much like how i was with God of War Assension........... BUT BOY WAS I WRONG! Like seriously i have never been so wrong in my life BOY! And you know what i did, i went to amazon and bought a ps4 along with God of War that very day (probably because i had some savings left). I played the game, i recorded the game and i reviewed the game. All on my channel ACCEPTEDGUY, check it out!",0,public,,1

Or do you think it was just a random little detail thrown in with no meaning?

I hope we see it drawn, it looks like it might be katana-esque since the sheath indicates it's one edged and the hilt is oval with a small guard. Doubt it's actually a katana though since Japan was acknowledged in game",185,public,Spoilers,1

GodofWar,t3_bw08et,My theory for God of War 5,"I have a theory that the next game will start with a fight with Thor where Thor places his hammer on Kratos while he kills Loki as he causes Ragnarok. 

Kratos will then travel to Hel pulling Loki out of Hel where he can meet Hela and he is warned that people don‚Äôt come back the same Kratos ignores her and takes Loki back. On there way back they get attacked by Freya and fight across 8 realms but not Asgard and they end their fight in the realm of the Valkyries where Kratos rips of her Freya‚Äôs wings but keeps her alive.

 Atreus and Kratos then have to escape back to Midgard and as they get back to the lake of the nine heimdal appears and try‚Äôs to kill Atreus/ Loki and he dies but Loki‚Äôs eyes are injured in the fight. Before his death heimdal blows his horns with his last breath signaling he start of Ragnarok. Kratos hunts down Freya and makes her help him save Loki‚Äôs eyes and give him back his vision she sees the love in which Kratos shows for Atreus and she helps. However the more magic used on Atreus corrupts him more and he wishes to take vengeance on the Aesir Kratos tries to stop him and they have a small fight but Atreus escapes. Kratos with the help of Freya hunts down Atreus, while Atreus returns to Hel and asks Hela to bring an army of the dead to attack Asgard, Hela accepts. Kratos and Freya catch up to Atreus in Midgard where Kratos warns him not to go through with this but when Atreus ignores  Kratos pled Kratos decides to stand with his son. 

They travel to the realm of the dwarfs to get an item they lets them travel to Asgard and when they returns they come across Odin Thor and an army at the bridge of Tyr. Freya then betrays them and is given new wings and a big fight ensues in which the world serpent dies. But Kratos destroys Thor‚Äôs hammer using the axe but the axe is destroyed in the process. Atreus kills Freya for betraying them.

 Odin flees to Asgard where Kratos and Atreus team up to fight Odin and Atreus kills Odin similar to the way Kratos kills Zeus. This opens Kratos‚Äô eyes to what he has become and Atreus and Kratos fight one last time. Soon the world serpent in thrown up out of Atreus‚Äô mouth and he grows big quickly and Thor returns where he fights the world serpent knocking him back in time and Thor delivers a fatal blow to kratos and Atreus kills Thor. Atreus cradles kratos similar to the painting at the end of this game and Atreus leaves travelling to a new world. Hopefully Egypt.  
 

Sorry if this is long haha 
EDIT: I know this has turned out more like a fan fiction now but I still like it 
Edit 2: I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll fit it in but I‚Äôd love to see Atreus call the leviathan axe to himself at a point maybe in the first fight with Thor",0,public,Spoilers,1

GodofWar,t3_bvkh5x,Is Cory Barlog gonna direct GoW 5 too?,"I feel like this man's enthusiasm  and dedication was one of, if not, the biggest reasons made the game as succesful as it is. After watching Raising Kratos i felt like he is truly the heart of God of War. One thing that impressed me was how he called out that one guy who tried to ""trick"" him because the pause menu wasn't really done and he tried to convince Cory that skipping animation was already there, even tho he didn't show him when Cory insisted. I felt like he kept pushing people just like that during the whole project so they didn't half-ass anything and approached the whole thing with great care.

I checked his twitter after watching the doc like i just said, and in a part of his twitter bio it says ""Tired. Finally done with the game."" so it left me a little worried about the future of the franchise. GoW 3 was fantastic and a great end to the first era of the story but at that time i remember i felt like it was a little step down from GoW 2 and didn't know the reason until last year when i saw Cory Barlog interviews. Maybe i am exaggerating but that is what i feel like, and i wanted to share it with you guys in this sub because if anywhere on the internet i can find people who also love God of War, it is probably here.

So in short, is there any confirmation or deconfirmation of Cory Barlog in next God of War project?",50,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bvs84m,Is Kratos the most underrated God?,"Greetings all :))

I was as usual doing a farming re-run on Plus +, and I was at the point where Freya brought back Thamur during the Baldur fight, when it stroke me: 

Kratos is the most nerfed ""God"" as crazy this might sound.  

What I mean by that:  
Kratos has no special God like powers other his supernatural strength which ties him at a Heracles level.   

He is not omnipotent, omnipresent, can't travel in time on demand, can't create life, bring back to life others, he doesn't have any magic or can practice spells, does not have gear-free abilities like Zeus, Hera, Athena, Hades, Odin, Freya, etc. 

Yes, he has cunning, intellect, very strong will, etc., but all those are characters and personalities traits.  

Wouldn't be interesting if he had some more Godly traits?",1,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bvfi39,Is it ok to brag out of joy?,"Hello everybody :))

I do not have anything *important* to say, but I would like to share my joy for something:
 
After ca. 30 years of gaming, its the first time **ever** that I competed a game to a perfect 100% on its hardest difficulty.   

Every map, goal, mission, quest, side or main, Easter Egg, top gear, statistical/numerical feat, and achievement for God of War is completed :D 

I know that this is not WoW when it comes to achievement accomplishment, but still, first time to complete a game to its absolute 100%.  

I have to admit that this was a Plus + run, ergo I was very well geared up, that makes it significantly easier than a regular **gmGoW** run, but nevertheless!

That's it, just wanted to share this with you guys, because I know that all of us here really love this game.


PS: I was at Muspelheim earlier this day doing the Impossible Trials, and I was at this round where you gotta take down 20 enemies, when things started to get heated up.   
I was at the limit, when the huge Orcs came, which I eventually took down, and when I saw that the counter went down only by one, I imagined poor Gimmly from Lord of the Rings telling me ""That still counts as one!"" üòÇ

GodofWar,t3_bv8tvl,I need to interview someone who remembers a lot about Zeus in these games.,"Hello, I'm a college student who is currently writing a paper on modern depictions of Zeus and how they differ from ancient depictions, and I'd like to include a video game. God of War is an obvious choice for this, as I know he's the main villain of one of the games, but I honestly know next to nothing about these games beyond that you're a tragic hero killing gods.

I figure some of ya'll probably know a ton about his depiction in these games, so I'd like to interview one or more of you to get a summary of how he acts, his personality, his goals, his failings, etc.",247,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bvg7o3,What do you think will ultimately be Kratos' arc throughout the upcoming games?,"Right now he's in a regretful state believing himself to be a bloodthirsty monster but I think he'll have an arc like Bruce Banner where he realizes that while his rage has gotten out of control in the past and hurt people, he doesn't have to completely suppress it and it can be a necessary evil in some scenarios. 

I think a great moment of development could be if he visits Greece and sees it in a prosperous state now that mankind no longer has to live under the rule of that pantheon. He killed a lot of people but his actions in the previous games still probably had a net positive effect in the long term. And even now, he really only uses his rage whenever Atreus is directly threatened which is far more of a paternal instinct than savage bloodlust.",5,public,,1

So I went to the Valkyrie area with around 8k mists, and accidentally started the fight (wasn't even looking at her!) and I was like, there go them mists, rip in pieces..

The fight was going quite well and I was downing here health quite rapidly. With my hp in the red, I weirdly got her on the first try, and was extatic! I had several times before been thinking, how can I ever kill a Valkyrie in the mist? Those run ups will SUCK.

Rushing with adrenaline and dopamin, I progressed the run, collecting 10k mists, only to die to the traps for the first time ever. Lololoo

Do you think it's possible that thanks to the Huldra brothers Mimir may have a mechanical body in the next game?

GodofWar,t3_buc8hs,Give me God of War difficulty is insane,"I don't know what to say.  Other than it's not hard necessarily, just absurd.  It straight up punishes aggressive gameplay and turns you into a parrying/rolling machine, where you wish you had more fingers to manage all the crazy button presses and keeping enemies offguard with Atreus.  I'm about 1/4 way through and so far Nightmares are the worst if you can't get them dead before they ""possess"" an enemy.  Currently stuck at  Daudi Hamarr and thinking of putting it down.

GodofWar,t3_bu00hb,Kratos' bloodlust and rage nicely mirrors the player's,"I haven't even played the game (I unfortunately don't have enough for a next-gen console) but it looks amazing. 

And even just from watching playthroughs, it's incredibly satisfying in moments when Kratos beats down hardy opponents, like bosses, or has those really brutal moments when he just wails on Baldur over and over again (specifically the quick-time events like the fight on top of the dragon). You'd think this would be hard to watch as he really goes for it, but because Baldur is such an annoyance you're sitting there rooting for Kratos as he beats the ever-living shit out of his enemies. 

This nicely mirrors Kratos' own rage and justification of such violence; it's only after the heat of the moment that you as the player sit back and go ""Damn, maybe that was harsh of me after all"". 

It's all sort of like what Egoraptor talks about in his Sequelitis on The Legend of Zelda. You want to obtain the Master Sword because it's literally more powerful at doing what you're playing the game to do (defeat evil) but also because the character needs to obtain it.

Just thought it was a really interesting parallel in GoW4, I love when the real-world motivations of the player to mechanically play the game actually tie into the tone, atmosphere or characterisation.",72,public,,1

Like that spirit who wanted us to destroy the statue, he said Thor showed up and killed his mom at the funeral of his dad. Kratos killed many innocence back in the day. Like the slave girl in GOW3 who got killed by  the door crank collapsing. Or even random people you can kill in GOW 1 and 2. Really puts it in perspective that Kratos was a monster just like Thor. Kratos was a slave and the champion of Olympus. Thor is willingly, the champion of Asgard. However, the Olympians feared Kratos because of his destruction to innocent towns as god of war, Zeus then killed him thinking that he would try to kill him, a threat. Kratos wanted nothing to do with ruling Olympus. Odin and Thor however are different. Thor murders giants and everyone else  at the behest of Odin. No fear of power struggle. Had Kratos continued to serve the Olympians until his old age like in this game, thats the kind of Thor were gonna see. A character who‚Äôs pure rage and does whatever the Aesir ask of him for their glory. Thor is a mirror of who Kratos used to be and I think that will be the scarier part for Kratos.

I would also like to take the time to add that everything we get with the dwarves is not necessarily ""good"".

A mad dwarven king sends his people to the brink of ruin for a quest. Well, they are ruined.

Ivaldi created a deadly mist that would, in turn, end up killing him.

GodofWar,t3_btnngi,Have fun and don't obsess over fully upgrading all your gear before NG+!,"Hey, I love this game! I love it's story, it's combat, worldbuilding, lore, everything! I have played through it three times now, including GMGOW on NG+ so i consider myself a bit of a veteran at this point and I keep seeing a lot of people with questions regardig endgame gear and how to get all armor sets fully upgraded before starting the first NG+.

&amp;#x200B;

My advise: don't bother. It may seem like a sensible thing to do but in NG+, in no time, you will have about 4 or 5 completely new armorsets, heaps of axe handles, blades pommels and talismans that outperform the epic or legendary versions at base level. This makes the effort put into all that NG gear feel completely useless. So i advise you to just get one armorset, a few handles and pommels you like, upgrade that to about max level so you have some good starting gear, upgrade the axe and blades to max level (they won't upgrade further in NG+) and open all nornir chests for the health an spartan rage meter (this also doesn't level any further in NG+) before starting NG+ but not more. Any of the nornir chests, runic attacks and summons, axe and blades upgrades you missed in NG, you can allways get later in NG+, though it makes it easier to gather those at the end of the first playthrogh, if you are starting an NG+ on a higher difficulty. Upgrading runic attacks is done with XP so this basically happens on it's own and can continue through into NG+, no problem.

The first playthrough should just be a fun experience, not a perfectionist slog, save that for later, in NG+, that's my advise.

GodofWar,t3_btfm09,A Quick Guide to Muspelheim Hard Trial 1: Kill Enemies in Quick Succession,"I've seen a few people mention that they've had trouble with this trial, and I remember being frustrated with it when I first tried it, so here are some tips to help you get through it if you're struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, if you have the wrong setup you're going to have a bad time. You need to equip runic attacks that have large areas of effect and/or very high damage, and ideally you want armour that gives you high stats in attack and runic (and perhaps cooldown).

&amp;#x200B;

Some recommended runics include Hel's Touch, Strike of the Utgard, Wrath of the Frost ancient, Glaive Storm, Nemean Crush, Hyperion Slam, Meteoric Slam.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first wave, kite the enemies and group them together, chip away at their health if you have low strength/runic stats. Once they're weakened and herded together, blast them with a runic (or two if needed) then mop up any survivors.

&amp;#x200B;

In the second wave, you can start by weakening the revenant to half health, but mainly you want to focus on the troll until it's stunned, then use the troll to kill the revenant. Use Atreus to keep the revenant in place and vulnerable to your steed. Put down your pet troll the moment you defeat the revenant and the animation should finish in time before the revenant respawns.

&amp;#x200B;

The third wave is the hardest because there are a lot of enemies and two of them hide underground. Similarly to the first wave, you want to kite and herd the enemies together, and chip away at the tatzelwurms' health if possible. Once they're grouped together smash them with a powerful runic or two such as Glaive Storm and/or Hyperion Slam. Mop up the survivors. If this is still difficult then use the talisman of the realms to buy yourself a few seconds to find an angle of approach.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's](https://youtu.be/w-B50e-vaoA) a video of how I did it on my current run, although I already have the full Zeus set here, so I didn't need to weaken enemies much before going for the kill.",14,public,,1

Killing a god and taking his weapon/head/boots is exactly what the old Kratos would do. Kratos isn‚Äôt that same person anymore. Part of me thinks it would be cool character/story wise if after we kill Thor, Kratos takes the hammer and destroys it. It would make sense for him in some ways, and it would be so satisfying that Kratos would destroy the god and weapon that wiped out his wife‚Äôs people and so many other innocent Norse folk. That way it could never harm anyone again. 

Sure it would stink not getting to use it ourselves, but it could make for a powerful plot point.",565,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_bs6f7t,Tyr‚Äôs temple implications on the next games,"I don‚Äôt know if this has been discussed but I was very surprised when I saw the Murals in Tyr‚Äôs temple with Icons from Japanese and Egyptian myths.

I think this means that the next games will explore the myths of the other Countries. Here‚Äôs my reasoning.

1. It seems we‚Äôre done with traversing the majority of the 9 realms and the new games must maintain the open world aspect so like Elder scrolls, we will go to different lands for new open world experiences.

2. The Story hasn‚Äôt  explained how Kratos got to Midgard to begin with and yet according to the panels in Jotenheim, Kratos arriving is a very big deal. 

3. We must do something about Ragnarok. The story seems to be going in the direction of the destruction of the 9 realms via Ragnarok but I don‚Äôt think it will happen. Odin wants to prevent this as well so you might think it‚Äôs a bad thing but I think this intentionally the opposite of the Old God of war where Kratos incites and apocalypse. In this game Kratos will end the Apocalypse.

4. I think the only way of preventing Ragnarok will be combining knowledge from all the other mythologies and lands and such. Tyr must have had a reason to travel to all these other mythologies and I think it will be that all the lands eventually combine there efforts to defeat Odin and also stop Ragnarok. 

That‚Äôs about what I think will happen. The next game will be Egypt and the last will be Japan and one of the games will probably go to back to Greece and Odin and his pantheon will be the over arching enemy chasing Kratos and Atreus through all the mythologies.",2,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_brvu2r,After watching Raising Kratos I have some thoughts about the narrative direction of the next few games,"At the conclusion of the documentary (which was amazing, Shannon Studstill, Yumi Yang, Cory Barlog and everyone at SSM who worked on the game seem like very passionate and driven people) Barlog talks about the nature of success and compares it to being a parent, I think what he says has narrative implications for the games to come and how they continue Atreus and Kratos' story. The direct quote is:

&gt;""...which is kind of, I guess, like a parent. You're gonna sacrifice, work really hard and then they're gonna fucking hate you in fifteen years and not talk to you for ten years and then they're gonna be like 'hey I remember why you were pretty good'""

It may be this is the narrative direction going forward, with Atreus and Kratos having a falling out and Atreus fulfilling his role as Loki in the mythology, working with the Norse pantheon in some way instead of against them for a time, and finally, given enough time, reconciling with his father.

Very excited to see what the team at SSM come up with and over a year after release still in awe at what they achieved in terms of narrative, gameplay and the world they built.

GodofWar,t3_bs91ai,Just Finished God of War (2018): The Good and Bad,"This is my first God of War game ever, and I just finished it. Here's what I loved, and what I didn't like (so much). For reference, I'm a big Souls fan + Bloodborne and Sekiro, so my opinions are from this background.

**Fantastic story + Music**

It's clear that a lot of love has gone into this game. Whoever wrote the story truly feels invested. The music drives home the emotional highlights. Kratos's journey with his son is a study in character development. I didn't expect a video game story to be this sophisticated and emotional.

Freya was magnificent as well. A complex personality, whom we love. And though we never see Kratos's wife and Atreus's mother, we can still feel her presence throughout the game.

The story is a beautiful work of art. The Baldur fights are cinematic accomplishments in their own right, and carry a lot of weight.

**Almost no Boss Fights**

The only ""real"" boss in the game is Sigrun - the Valkyrie queen. The others big enemies are just repeats of one another. This is one of the biggest departures from the Souls games.

**Combat is Frenetic: Can be Either Good or Bad Depending on Taste**

Unlike Souls games, Kratos fights multiple enemies at all times. In Souls games, fights are methodical, and carefully controlled. In GoW, there are waves and waves of enemies, luck plays a big role, and you get surrounded often. It's a matter of taste. I personally didn't like fighting multiple enemies at once, but that's the GoW signature I suppose.

**Can Induce Motion Sickness**

For someone who gets seasick easily, there's altogether too much boat riding! In the first 5 minutes of the game, I had to turn off the camera shake options. Without that, I wouldn't have been able to continue at all. But there's still a bunch of boat travel that induces motion sickness. And at one point in the game, you have to be on a huge ship that's floating around. Very bad!

**Difficulty Levels are Messed Up**

The game's difficulty at higher levels consists of more health for enemies, and more damage taken. Unlike Souls' games, where the difficulty is more organic. It's difficult to explain, but when playing ""Give me a Challenge"" with no skills unlocked, I didn't feel satisfied beating mobs. Just tired. It's a bit ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottom Line: Story Makes up for it All**

The story and the music are killer. It's what makes the game awesome in my opinion. I won't be playing it again on harder difficulties, because like I said, I don't like the way the game makes things hard. But it's been an amazing experience. Even the lack of boss fights (exception Sigrun) doesn't detract from the experience. I'm very happy I bought and played it!",0,public,,1

There are other similarities between GoW2 and GoW2018 such as elements of time travel, a tyrant of a ruler/king (Zues/Odin), a man trapped in a tree being tortured by the tyrant and the infamous swords which tip the balance.

GodofWar,t3_br9iuv,My GOW review... average game. Find out why.,"Hello,

Here is my GOW review, and yes I won't be kind with it.

Overall it's a masterpiece in term of graphism and environment design, but poor in term of gameplay, and rather boring to play.

Fighting is the core of the game and it sucks. Fights are rather simple, repetitive, no room for expressing your own style : press attack button like a retard, duck, attack, go to next fight, repeat...You can never make a smart move using something unusual, natural feature, or even escape a fight!Finishing a big enemy always ends by a pre-recorded cinematic scene, which kills the intensity of fights... killing is only done indirectly.

And about 50% of the game is non-playing time:- Tons of puzzles games which have nothing interesting and after each of them you blame the developers for having you wasting 10 minutes.- Watching thousands of times the very same boring mini cut-scenes occurring every 2 minutes : climbing a wall, crawling, opening a chest, improving a weapon, taking a gate, achieving an enemy, talking to the dwarfs, etc.- Collect tons of shit that I don't care, to buy/activate improvements that I don't see the effect, through menus that are more complex than filling my annual tax report.- Try to find where you have to go and commute.

If you remove the amazing graphism, it's realy an average game.Zelda BOTW which has a similar gameplay, makes fights a million time more interresting and intense, makes you want to progress and collect new items, and gives you a lot of pleasure commuting (exploring wild places, riding a horse, gliding the parachute...)  


**EDIT A FEW DAYS LATER**  


**Thank you all for your insights and the discussion.**  
**I checked some videos of pro playing** and indeed, they are doing little things that I did not do in the game.  
But not much. GOW plays more or less the same whether you are good or not. You still walk on the same narrow pre-defined tracks with zero movement freedom, you still do the very same fights that you cannot skip and you still kill ennemies the very same way : retard push R1/R2 until it's over.   
**Overall GOW gameplay does not allow any room for freedom or growing with it.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good counter-example with the new game I just started : **Gravity Rush.**  
**From the first hour playing, I felt like a powerful super hero (DC/Marvel) doing incredible things ! Something I never felt with GOW.**   
And then I watched some video on youtube : it's again a whole other game ! Pro players are doing things I'm not even remotely close to do.  


Anyway, thanks for the chat.",0,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bqmztv,It's the Ending that matters.,"Hello everyone :)

In the recent light of events with some TV series, and some videogames that didn't had the Ending they should, they unfortunately lost a lot from their glamour and status.   

Now, in our case' it is talked openly that the next GoW might be the last one for Kratos (See Jutunheim Mural Theory, etc.)

I'm gonna speak open and from the heart: 

I'm not ready for this.  

I don't want to see it happen.   

I also don't think it *should* happen.      

It is indeed very important to go when it's the right time, and go at your peak.   
That's what makes changes an elite game into legendary (if it's not already).    
I just feel there's still more to give, and as technology and gaming art (direction, photography, cinematics, etc.) progress, so does Kratos.   

I would love an Egyptian/Mayan/Asian addition.   

As for the Ending???  

Well, the Olympus throne is vacant... 
And Greece needs a God at Olympus, so why not a happy ending after we've enjoyed a little bit more Kratos? üòä",4,public,Spoilers,1
GodofWar,t3_bqwue0,"Loved the game, but disappointed with the ending","Spoilers, of course!

Now, I know that I was never going to defeat Odin and Thor in the first game of what will most likely be a series, but they put way too much build up and foreshadowing for those characters only for them... have no meaningful role in the story. Thor only shows up in a secret ending, Odin never makes an appearance.

When the game ended in the realm of the giants, I thought I had finished just one third of the game because there were so many loose endings to deal with. For example, what happened to the realm of the elves after we helped the white ones? What was that big bird in Norse Hell that we didn't fight and it looked very much like it was going to be a boss, given that this is GoW and fighting big enemies is a must? And what about all the locked realms like Asgard that kept teasing us that there would be more?

Feels like they meant for this game to be huger, but then they ran out of budget. This game was going to be a 10/10 if they kept going on, but that ending left a sour taste in my mouth. I would give a  maximum of 8/10 because of the journey.",0,public,Spoilers,1
GodofWar,t3_bqkggf,Minerva's Tapestry,"The natural assumption is to think that the series title ""God of War"" relates to Kratos inheriting the mantle when he defeated Ares.  However, I believe Barlog and company are actually playing on a Phantom Menace theme insofar as the larger multiple mythology arc being manipulated by a hidden hand .

Athena is also one of the Greek gods of war (war and wisdom to be precise) and she has also now appeared in both mythologies influencing the actions of Kratos.  What if she is the god of war for which the franchise is named?

Roman and greek gods are commonly viewed as being one in the same with the roman equivelent of Athena being Minerva.  One story attributed to Minerva is that she once wove a tapestry for a competition that depicted her defeating all of the other gods.

Barlog and the SMS crowd have proven exceptional students of mythology.  What if Athena/Minerva is using Kratos as her instrument for defeating **all** gods (her literal and figurative designs being woven to plan).  This would likely mean that when SMS does decide to wrap up the franchise she will likely be the final boss.",5,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bqe7t1,"Just finished off the story, have a couple questions","1. Is there any story that happens after returning from jotunheim? I‚Äôm aware that there is a secret ending (I‚Äôll check it out tomorrow) and that there‚Äôs probably some bit of story after defeating all the valkyries. But other than those, do I have the full story?

2. I read an article about new game plus that says you keep the blades of chaos. Does the game address the fact that you already have them at all? Or do you return home when Atreus gets sick to ‚Äúget‚Äù the blades anyway?

3. I swear I remember Mimir or maybe Freya saying at one point that Freya was cursed to be unable to use magic to harm another being. However, during the fight with Baldur, the things that she summons definitely do damage, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the shockwave attack from the giant did some damage. Am I just missing something, or maybe I‚Äôm misremembering, or did the devs mess up?

4. I did this playthrough on GMAC difficulty. How much harder would new game plus be on GMGOW? Am I going to be getting one-shotted by basic enemies, or is it a small difficulty increase?

5. General opinion on axe vs blades? To me the blades only feel useful for runic attacks and if I‚Äôm up against a horde of low power enemies. For single targets or groups of strong enemies I almost always prefer the axe.

6. After picking up Mimir at the end of the game, he says Brok and Sindri took a bunch of measurements of him. Any idea what those are for?",11,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_bqj2bp,GoW 5 and how Kratos Being Dead Could Work (Slight Spoilers),"I‚Äôve been a fan of the franchise for about a decade now. Despite what many people have said, this newest game is not the first time they have told a deep and meaningful story. All the past games are a tragedy about a man‚Äôs anger, hate, and selfishness, and how that brings the downfall of him, his loved ones, and the whole world. Really, it‚Äôs the anger and fear of everyone, which is a consistent theme in the original games. The new game doesn‚Äôt work nearly as well unless you know about the past adventures of Kratos, as they provide subtext for who he is, what he has done, and what he is capable of.

One of the things I wanted clarification on in 4 is, exactly what happened after 3? For all we know, the world could have restarted, this time with a Norse Pantheon, and it has been thousands of years, since Kratos is immortal. Past events have really only been touched on, and I think they need to be fleshed out in 5. It could explain who Tyr is, the giants, if there are multiple worlds (Greek, Norse, Egypt, Japanese). Most importantly, it would explain what Kratos‚Äô sacrifice at the end of 3 really meant.

At the end of 4 we saw something that looked like foreshadowing of Kratos death. Anyone who has played the past games knows that you can‚Äôt really keep Kratos dead. He has canonically in pretty much most of his games, and he always escaped from the Underworld. That‚Äôs how bad ass he is. It seems like they might want to keep him dead, and the only way for that to work, is if he chooses to do so voluntarily.

Kratos is still carrying the sins of his past. One of the things that stood out to me, was the whole thing about him killing his father. Really, killing Zeus is at the bottom of the list of ‚ÄúWorst Things Kratos Has Ever Done‚Äù. Most obviously, his skin, which represents him murdering his family, ranks way up there. It is still a thing, but it is never alluded to as far as I know in 4. I think they were waiting to exfoliate further in the future.

I think Kratos should choose to stay dead, either after a sacrifice to save Atreus or someone else. It is well in his power to stay alive, but after his journey of really becoming a new man, he wants to truly atone for his sins. The world that he ended up destroying. He chooses to stay dead as a way to pay back everyone he has killed. And in the end, he meets his family, the one that he killed, and the ash from his skin peels away. I think that would be a beautiful way to end his story. It would represent him truly being free of his guilt, which has been his goal from literally the first screen of the original GoW 1. Of course, there is his other wife Faye, who I am not really attached to, since we never saw her and is newer, but I think she could be involved as well. Atreus learns from the example that Kratos‚Äô has taught him, and picks up the mantle.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Kratos chooses to stay dead to atone for his sins. He meets his family and his ash-colored skin turns back to it's original color.",0,public,Spoilers,1

I have axe fully upgraded and blades are 1 upgrade from max. Can't remember what armor by name but I know it's one of the purple sets with the red shoulder guard. 

Is it this difficult for you guys as well? Is it a gear/stat thing or is my skill just not honed enough. I understand how to parry and dodge but with enemy swarms and the camera it's hard not to take a hit every now and then between kills.

GodofWar,t3_bpt6ue,Question about combat/difficulty settings,"I just bought a PS4 and God of War yesterday, and I‚Äôm starting the game on Normal difficulty. 

I love the graphics and storyline so far, but I‚Äôm finding the combat a bit confusing and difficult to adapt to. I‚Äôm not someone who‚Äôs usually *great* at games, but I play virtually all story modes on ‚Äònormal‚Äô difficulty and don‚Äôt usually have an issue until late stages of the game. 

god of war is challenging for me though. It‚Äôs the first time in a game where I‚Äôve died multiple times in a row at very early tutorial-like stages of the story, mostly because I‚Äôm struggling with when to throw the axe, when to fight up close, when to block, and when to tell the kid to shoot arrows. 

Is this something I‚Äôll get the hang of as I continue the game? (I just started towards the mountain) Or will it get more difficult if I‚Äôm already struggling in the early stages?

**TLDR: I had to do the tutorial sequences and the fight against the Stranger like 10 times on Normal difficulty because I suck, should I stick it out or reduce the difficulty?**",65,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bq14gc,Midgame Armor? Gow4,"I currently have the level 3 metal-plated guard armor. I just got the blueprints for the three Realm of Fire armor sets, Traveler Armor, and can almost craft the breastplate for the Ancients armor set.

All of those are level 4 sets. The custom sets are cool and all, but it seems like by the time I get the necessary components they'll already be outdated. Right now I have access to the level 4 plated volunder armor, which is superior to one of the Realm of Fire sets, barring the perk and 36 additional strength.

GodofWar,t3_bpldph,"I love this game even more, thanks to my little niece","I've been playing this game for quite some time. Since I bought it in august i've finished it almost 4 times, sometimes I just replay it from the begining just to fight Baldur again and again :)

I have a little niece, she's 6 years old and loves watching me play videogames (her personal favorite is The Evil Within 2, yeah, even with those scary moments, not adecuated for a child xD), and today I replayed GoW again. She was reluctantly at first. ""Not this one, play Sebastian's game"", refering to TEW 2, she said, but I told her, ""this game also has zombies"" (kinda). So she sit quietly and startes watching.

A few minutes after I started she understood the main plot! ""Her mom's dead?"" ""Who is that bearded man?"" (Baldur), ""Why he felt nothing?"" ""What is a God?"" I know these are some heavy shit for a 6yo. Dead, violence, religion, but I tried to explain it the best I could and she got it! She went to sleep but she made me promise her the next time I play GoW, I will tell her.

GodofWar,t3_bpxk39,Question about the game tied to mythology,"About Mjolnir. In mythology Mjolnir is made as a result of the story of Loki cutting Sif‚Äôs hair (Thor‚Äôs wife) and getting dwarves to make new hair as well as other gifts for the Gods. Mjolnir was Forged by Brokkr and Sindri just like they claim in the game. So if Atreus is Loki then is there a different way Mjolnir was made in God of War? Or am I just wasting time trying to think about all the details of the game tied to the mythology. I love the game and I know there are parts in the game that don‚Äôt happen in Norse mythology like the story of Jormungandr being sent back in time as a result of Ragnarok which is a short story minor tells but have I missed any story about the forging of Mjolnir other than Brokkr and Sindri claiming to have forged it in the end?

GodofWar,t3_bpr7k5,My worry about the sequel(s),"First off I'd like to say, before playing this game I fucking hated Kratos. After playing GoW1-3 I found Kratos to be an irredeemable prick, which is why I put off playing this game for so long. Last week on a whim, I borrowed the game from a friend and finished(100%) it today, and I was thoroughly impressed. The game was so fucking good. To illustrate how much I enjoyed it: Spider-Man was a good game but I wouldn't buy a system for it, God of War is so goddamn good that I would buy a PS4 for it.

So my point is that one of the main reasons I enjoyed this game so much, as opposed to any of the previous games in the franchise, is its story. The premise to be more precise. Instead of an epic quest or a vengeance quest, it's just a personal journey for a father and son to fulfill their dead wife/mom's final wish. Whatever conflict that happened between the duo and the Aesir just so happened cause the gods got in their way.

So my worry is, especially cause of the implications of the ending, that the sequels won't be able to do the same set-up. Sure I'll probably still enjoy the ride, but I fear that I won't be as happy as I am with this one.",13,public,,1

With your undodgeables and your lack of telegraphing. And GMGOW+ difficulty.

For anyone wondering:

Hel's touch (consistently stuns her), River of knives(also stuns consistently and deals a lot of damage),Nemean crush, Hyperion Grapple, Talisman of the Realms

The best axe pommel is the forbidden grip of ages because it makes Pride of the Frost your strongest normal move.

Every time she does the Staff aoe, hit her with an axe throw, Hyperion grapple and Nemean crush her and then use the talisman to spam blade switch stance heavy attack. This deals a lot of damage and there's nothing she can do abou it. For everything else, punish with pride of frost.

The undodgeable I'm talking about is when she does the wing swipe into a guard breaking attack. You can't dodge out of the way of the guard break (if you can, I wasn't able to). Sometimes she also does the unblockable wing stab out of nowhere (only seen it when her eyes glow)

Zeus armor and Sindri chest+. Cannot imagine how long it would take without Zeus armor.

Atreus' only uses are wolves for free stun, resurrection stones and the occasional healing stone that *might* make a difference (ground fire and small ice shards don't instantly kill you)

Not the hardest thing I've ever done, but really goddamn satisfying.

GodofWar,t3_bprqjs,God of war theories for God of war 2,"This theory is thought by me, I do not know if someone has posted it before


God of war 2 (Nordic Saga)

I would start with kratos in the sindri and brok store (the one in the temple of Tyr in the lake of the 9) talking to them while they improve the ax (with some new skill).

In the conversation between Sindri, Brok and Mimir (who would follow in the waist of kratos) comment that the Fimbulvetr is ending but that during the great snowfall the lake has frozen.

That at this moment you just improve the ax and they tell you to go to the lake of the nine (completely frozen) to taste it. At that moment you see that the platform to call Jormungandr goes down and that she drops Atreus (and notes as a tremor that jormungandr has moved) and tells you that she has been talking to her (friends)

At that moment you are ready to go to the lake of the 9 to try it. (Here would start the gameplay) You kill a couple of enemies to get control of the character and the ax (as a tutorial plan, as in previous games)

Once killed a couple of enemies, as Sindri and Brok have told you that the Fimbulvetr is running out a kinematics that the frozen ground of the lake begins to break and has to run to the temple of Tyr, while enemies chase you (more than anything they run so that they do not fall into the water either) at the end kratos and atreus arrive at the temple before the ground thaws.

After this they would go home with the portal in the store.

(This part that I just described would be like the tutorial of the game, as the part since you start at 1 until before the fight with baldur, but in the game that takes about 40-50 min)

Once at home the final cinematic of 1 would come out in which Thor leaves, but this time it is not a dream and you have to face it. (This would be the classic boss at the beginning of the game)

The fight would be in several phases

  -  Phase 1: Thor tells us why he is going for us and kratos and atreus have no choice but to go for him. The combat would be very frenetic and spectacular (As practically everyone in the saga). Once we eliminate almost all of Thor's life, there would be a cinematic in which atreus takes the stone to travel through the portals between the kingdoms (We as a player would not know where he is going at that moment) 

  -  Phase 2: This phase would be the same as the first one but this time without daring (so you can not help us with your arrows) an equally spectacular combat with incredible Thor movements like throwing hammer rays or taking energy absorbing rays with the hammer to then attack with more force. Once removed almost the entire life bar would come another cinematic.
In this we would see how Kratos and Thor chop the Leviathan ax and the Mjolnir making sparks fly while in the distance we see Jormungandr approach in the distance with atreus on his head.
Jormungandr with anger goes to Thor to eat it, but Thor hits Kratos skyward and Thor goes with him, landing the 2 on the back of Jormungandr while this is the only thing he gets with his bite is to destroy the house of Kratos and atreus


  -  Phase 3: Phase 3 would be the last part of the fight where Thor and Kratos would fight on Jormungandr's back as it moves through the skies. By removing almost all the bar of life to Thor we would see another cinematic where we would see that Thor goes to the head of Jormungandr running, and just when he reaches it jumps and charges the hammer with thunder falling from the sky to strike a death Punch.
Jormungandr would fall dead on the lake of the nine, falling on top of the temple of Tyr destroying it completely while Kratos and atreus jump from its back to the mainland along with Thor. Thor would realize that he has just killed his mortal enemy of Ragnarok thinking he can dodge the prophecies that he would die at the hands of Jormungandr. So he would quickly go to Asgard to tell the other gods that prophecy can be avoided and that no one is certain death. This would make Thor even more arrogant than he already is by believing he can not die (he's clearly wrong)

This would no longer be the continuation of the game but the continuation of the fight against Thor

In the same game but later (possibly at the end of the game) Kratos and Thor (Thinking Thor who is immortal) would fight, but Kratos would kill Thor with the ax that would be impregnated with the poison of the serpent (This happens the first time we we find Jormungandr in God of War, when Kratos throws his ax to the lake of the 9 and returns the ax to us, in that precise moment in God of War we get a message saying Imbuido de Eitr or Eirt Imbued in English)

This would be my beginning and the death of Thor for the next God of War

GodofWar,t3_bpqtjc,"Talon Bow upgrade bug, can't upgrade my bow anymore.","Hi all, I'm encountering a bug and have no idea how to fix it or if a fix is even possible. I beat the game a year ago when it first came out and put it aside since I had other games to play at the time. I started it up last night to try and 100% it and start over on NG+. The first thing I did was went into the skills to start purchasing everything I didn't already have and noticed some of Talon Bow upgrades were locked stating I had to upgrade the bow first before I could unlock them so I went to see Brok and Sindri. I can't find the upgrade bow option anywhere in the upgrade section.

It's honestly fascinating to watch now, knowing where the series went after Ascension turned out lackluster. Something that really stands out is that a lot of what these guys are saying- particularly Jaffe and Barlog- seem to foreshadow the direction taken by God of War PS4. It's even clearer after watching [Raising Kratos](https://youtu.be/lJZWKBDXXFY). Some examples: 

Jaffe says that Kratos' story is essentially a guy who puts work in front of his family and loses them. Made me instantly think of Christopher Judge's interview in the doc.

Apparently Barlog was the one who came up with Kratos hugging his wife and child during the Ares fight, which added emotion to the fight.

There was plenty of talk about how they wished they could have dived more into Kratos as a person.

I'd definitely recommend checking it out.",1,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bpeer9,A guide to skap slag and XP/hacksilver exploits in NG+,"Anyone who's tried to upgrade equipment in new game plus will know just how expensive it all can be. Purchasing and fully upgrading a full set of armour can cost over a million hacksilver and almost 200 skap. If you're looking to upgrade all the armour, pommels and talismans then expect to have to do around 4-5 full playthroughs of the game, and to repeatedly grind the challenge realms for rare crafting materials.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is a certain quirk in the game that can be exploited to farm XP and/or skap slag at a rate that can net you very large amounts in no time. The exploit utilises the way the game saves progress. In certain situations, if you complete a labour you will be awarded XP for it. However if you are killed in combat, or restart from last checkpoint before proceeding to the next one, then the labour is reset to where it was before the encounter, but you still keep the XP you were awarded. To give an example, if you have already shattered 29 frozen enemies before your next encounter, then freeze and shatter the next draugr you see. Doing so will net you 3500 XP or more, depending on your multiplier (in my case I get 3500 x 1.65 = 5775 XP). Now restart checkpoint and do it again for another deposit of XP. Do this as often as you want before moving on and cashing in all your XP.

&amp;#x200B;

If you stack a few labours so they are all near completion then you could clear them all in each reset for a much larger XP injection. If the labours you complete give skap slag, then that too can be stacked in some cases, but not others (for example opening the final Jotnar shrine cannot be exploited since it autosaves and sets a new checkpoint).

&amp;#x200B;

I recorded a couple of videos to show a few examples.

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted this [first clip](https://youtu.be/MctU5hlQ2cE) before, showing a very quick and simple way to duplicate skap slag. Can be done the first time you visit Muspelheim and Niflheim. u/owkle pointed out that there was an even more efficient way to do it, so I decided to record the next clip to show it.

&amp;#x200B;

In this [second clip](https://youtu.be/4S9G5oz4IYU), I had already summoned Atreus' runic 59/60 times, discovered all hidden chambers and opened 6/7 of them. I travelled to the beach in Alfheim where the final doorway is and summoned my 60th runic for 5775 XP then opened the hidden chamber for another 3102 XP plus 9 skap (if I hadn't already discovered the door before then it might be possible to get 18 skap here, untested). Thamur's corpse is an even better choice of location for this exploit since it is much faster to reach it than this beach in Alfheim.

&amp;#x200B;

In this [third clip](https://youtu.be/GA7VKqaXKhk), I had already shattered 28/30 frozen enemies, tripped 97/100, and cleaved 45/50. Completing these labours on the first few enemies gets me 12787 XP each time.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking that last clip further, here is a [fourth clip](https://youtu.be/b1RcHjXkd5Y) showing a longer (failed) run of the 100 enemy challenge. In this one I completed the labours for shattering 30, cleaving 50, and tripping 100 enemies, killing 400 draugr, 15 travellers, and 20 trolls, for a gain of 30,000 XP in a few minutes work. This is my preferred way of ""grinding"" since I enjoy the combat and am working on completing this challenge with the Zeus armour anyway.",8,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bos3pi,Jotunheim Mural,"Hello everyone :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I started a new game at Give Me God of War level so I get those two shields, and when I arrived at Jotunheim to spread the ashes, I watched this amazing cinematic again.     

&amp;#x200B;

Then, at the last mural where Kratos is supposed to die by J√∂rmungandr I noticed something: 

&amp;#x200B;

This is **NOT** Kratos!   
In all other murals, Kratos has a plain red pteruga (skirt) with a simple pattern.   

On the last mural, it's entirely another one, with different pattern, colours, and what appears to be' more characteristically Nordic than Hellenic.    

Lastly, the figure's right arm is missing.   

&amp;#x200B;

And then it stroke me: It was **Tyr** sacrificed his right arm to Fenrir, the giant wolf (and son of Loki) in the Nordic Sagas!!  

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed at late game that Atreus/Loki, has his Father's Spartan Chiton wrapped around his waist, the same that Kratos had his Blades wrapped and kept!! 

&amp;#x200B;

The beauty of this game is unparalleled, every single detail is marvellous &lt;3",76,public,Spoilers,1

 After kratos kills Ares he receives the more powerful blades of Athena which were made with not a warrior in mind but a God during the beginning these blades are powerful enough to wound and kill a God unlike the blades of chaos. 

At the beginning of GOW 3 kratos falls into the river Styx and the blades of Athena are destroyed and rusted but are recreated into the blades of exile by Athena these are the most powerful iteration not only do they contain strong fires but they can also be infused with different other magical properties and are powerful enough to be able to destroy the heart of a Titan which aligns perfectly with what Ares wanted a weapon in the hands of a warrior that could kill a God my belief is that these blades are powerful enough to kill and defeat a Titan,God,fury even the God of death himself survive and ignite in the harsh environments of Hell what do you think of the power of these blades considering that they are kratos primary weapons.",5,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_boned6,God Of War Theories,"GOD OF WAR SPOILERS AHEAD

At the end of the game we see the plot twist in which Atreus reveals to his father that he is Loki. According to Norse mythology and in particular the myth of the assassination of Baldur, loki hands the mistletoe to another god (who is blind, to keep in mind), and makes him throw it at Baldur, killing him.
But if this myth had been completely ""copied"", that is, the blind god in this case was kratos who, he killed Baldur as if he were the blind god, only a link between Atreus and Baldur? In the next gow maybe you will discover with a huge plot twist, that in all this, kratos was nothing but a pawn to pave the way for Atreus for a much much bigger journey?
If so, having empathized a lot with the two guys, I hope my theory will be denied .. I don't know if I could handle it emotionally xD

GodofWar,t3_boon1g,What gods would you like to fight?,"Hello everyone, I just finished another run of GoW and I started to wonder and appreciate how the creators managed to create some many different and unique fight with the bosses from the Greek trilogy to the current norse game, now after giving some thoughs and playing a bit smite, I started to wonder if the franchise continues, what gods would the people of this subreddit would like to fight more than anything.

My personal top 5:

1)Susano: The god of the storm and the most violent among the shinto pantheon, I am sure Kratos will get a lot of fights with him because of his short temper, besides his powerful sword could be a good match against the blade of chaos

2) Set: This guy is a shapeshifting and one of the most evil jerks in the egyptian pantheon, seriously this guy actually could even be a great main villain for a whole trilogy

3) Sun Wukong: While I know this fight could be one sided since Wukong is very OP but c'mon Wukong vs Kratos has a lot of potential to be one of the most espectacular fight of the franchise, since the monkey king has a lot of varieties of magic and martial techniques that can add a lot of unique mechanics and a veyr flashy fight

4) Bellona: Roman Goddess of war, although I think i want this fight more because I want to see the reaction of Kratos at the moment he sees a new pantheon of gods dominating Greece with Iron fist again.

5) Huƒ´tzil≈çp≈çchtli: This guy is the god of human sacrifices, sun and war, basically the patron god of the aztec empire and a very vicious one. Basically Kotal Kahn from the new mortal kombat games got huge inspirations from this guy",2,public,,1
GodofWar,t3_boderk,The feeling of growing up with Kratos.,"Some spoilers ahead. You've been rewarned.

When the first God of War came out, I was about 15. It was clearly an adult game with loads of violence and sex. Initially took an interest because for a ps2 game it looked amazing, then I played it. And realised that the graphics and scale were just the beginning. The two major sequels after that were true to form and incremental improvements. 2nd one was a slight letdown in terms of not being able to slay major gods. 3 was incredible. The violence, the personal nature of the rage, the ascension of Athena after the fall of Olympus, the Blades through all this. All amazing. Special notable point, its exclusives like this that have kept me with the ps consoles. Once I played GoW3, I thought maybe this is the end.
Then a new God of War was announced. And they didn't call it 4. I knew things would change, I didn't know whether I wanted that or not.
I'd been trying to look up reviews and because of some algorithm I received this YouTube notification which showed me that Athena and the Blades were in this game. I then decided I didn't want to know. I got the game on digital, thought they deserved full price with no middle men after all this time.
By God, did they deserve it. From the first fight with Baldur, every Valkyrie, the Elves, the puzzles, the storytelling and the portrayal of a calmer and more intelligent father. Kratos was a father in game 1 but he didn't really embrace it until game 3 where he suddenly felt fatherly for Pandora. 

Also one huge thing that changed between the original series and now is that I became a big brother to a sister 18 years younger than i. The whole father figure thing started to make sense. I understood Kratos well in this game and from the documentary it was clear that Cory Barlog reshaped Kratos because of his little girl. Weird how that worked out. Whether it was the emotion of Freya wanting to protect her son by sacrificing herself, or Kratos accepting his fate as just being a vehicle for Arteus becoming what he's meant to be. The strong ties of family and friendship binds you to the story of the game. And the Valkyries, they help you to value your soul because, you pretty much have to give a part of it to survive those beasts.
It's been a journey, maybe God of War has been a total of 200 hours of my life. But those 200 have affected me as a person, whether it's about having an outlet for rage whilst being entertained or to truly understand humans, humanity and growth. The 4 game console journey along with one handheld one has shown me things I won't otherwise have known, but most importantly it has given me the timely life lessons of controlling and using your rage, moving on from tragedy, and finally valuing relationships like nothing else has.
Kratos has been raised well.",23,public,Spoilers,1

And to our surprise we saw the Plus Update.   

That was one of the nicest moments in my gaming ""career"".    

&amp;#x200B;

It is so pleasant to finally get  to see all suits, and gear, as also to get that complete depth that this game has to offer, and all that for free' no extra charge.  

So Thank You Santa Monica Studios, that was that sweet cherry on top of that masterpiece you made.  

&amp;#x200B;

One think I would like to mention for the sequel of the new God of War, is that I would very much like it if we could continue from our last save on this game.   

One thing that has switched me off and got me exhausted about the previous games of the series, was that somehow Kratos would always magically lose absolutely all his gear and powers and start  over again, and again, and again (so the games are challenging and you get to build up gear and abilities), but that's something that is absolutely not necessary any more.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of losing everything for some X silly reason, Kratos (us) could keep all that he worked for, and find better gear and more abilities on the other game.   

The mobs don't need to be level one and we fighting with a stick again.  

They can be level 12.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now a question if I may to this beautiful community:   

&amp;#x200B;

For the very first time, I've made the perfect game. Every labour, every secret, raven, chest, favour, in all realms, is completed except one: out of all collectibles, I've missed the second legendary chest on The Mountain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is that after the demolitions, there is no way up any more as it seems (?) and I'm stack at this sad 99.99% accomplishment.   

&amp;#x200B;

Is this chance blown forever in this game, or does someone knows a way to that second chest in the Mountain?

Even though I haven't completed the main questline yet, I look forward to the next game and hope that it'll be one that I can play to a greater degree of independence (i.e. without needing sighted assistance at all ideally).

GodofWar,t3_bnch8r,"Tyr, Ares, Kratos, and a revelation.","Hello everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

As now many of us have played the game (I assume) and try to have second looks on it, I've noticed a few details and have some thoughts to share.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, even though it becomes repetitive, it's something that has to be said: hands down in the top 10 videogames of all time. The cinematography, the music, the arc, the graphics, and the amazing details have topped everything we've seen and are second to none in its category.

&amp;#x200B;

A few thoughts about the story:

&amp;#x200B;

In the game we see Tyr who as God of War in Norse Mythology appears as kind, wise, peaceful, trying to avoid bloodshed, and undo injustice.

In the Greek Mythology, his equivalent Ares is portrayed as a polar opposite of Tyr: weak, sneaky, coward running from battle, stealing and deceiving, bloodthirsty, and schizophrenic.

By all means, Ares is the very worst of all Hellenic Pantheon.

Now, it is not mandatory to take these analogies to Kratos word by word, but what I do perceive from the arc, is that the Kratos of Greece that was more like Ares, is phasing into Tyr as he is adventuring in the Norse lands.

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of the game, the brilliant script is showing us Kratos on ""Greek Mode"" at his peak: he is indifferent, stoic, careless, and in a Spartan Survival mode. He minds his own business, does not interfere if there is no necessity to interfere and he is literally Laconic. Does what he must do and doesn't what is he mustn't.

If Kratos has to go from A to B, and next to B is a baby being murdered by someone that is not an obstacle to him, he'll not interfere.

All this changes as he spends time with his child and sees things from Atreus' perspective, as also the paternal instinct kicks in, and transmits into a benevolent God of War by seeing what Tyr has done in this narrative.

This can be seen specifically at Jotunheim when he firstly accepts his past, and is ready to be a FATHER.

He hides his blades no more, and seems that he is not going to be dismissive to any Atreus' questions about his past as he did before.

...and then... the murals at Jotunheim. He realises that everything was destined to happened for a reason, and sees his own death on the hands of his child, as the Serpent that kills him comes out of Atreus'/Loki's mouth, ergo he is at his command, or even the same.

And he accepts that. The moment they scatter Frey's (Freyr) ashes, he **knows**, he is **free**, he has **accepted** what comes, and has made his peace with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Two things to be taken into consideration too, are firstly Mimir's comments for Atreus' after the boy lost control and attacked his father.

***""You know brother, you know the boy's true nature""***

Atreus has a **dark side**, and I think we are going to see it as he also phases into Loki.

The second moment to take into consideration is at the fight with Baldur in front o Freya, when he knows that she will willingly give her life for he child, no matter how monstrous he might be.

That's what every father or mother does, and after what he sees at the Jotunheim mural and his change into a real father, Kratos now realises what must happen and accepts it.",49,public,Spoilers,1

In god of war 2018 kratos is far more reserved with control over his anger and again everything the including animations serve to prove that point. But the blades of chaos remakes the exact same animations from the first game but still somehow communicates something completely different. What before looked like kratos getting lost in the lust of violence now looks like control, and again they did this with animations that look practically identical to earlier installments... how?",27,public,Spoilers,1

GodofWar,t3_bn8qmq,Ramblings about GoW‚Äôs camera,"I was recently watching a Game Maker‚Äôs Toolkit video about cameras in games where Mark talked about some of the problems he had with the game‚Äôs camera. Specifically that it took the existing wide shot which combat took place in in past games and made it completely over-the-shoulder instead. So I started thinking about the camera and what purpose was served by changing it so much from the original games. And this is what I came up with: 

The original GoW games were all about player empowerment. Badass combos, sexy ladies to bang, screen-clearing spells, vicious kills, these were all meant to make he player feel powerful. Yeah, there‚Äôs challenge, and significant challenge at that, but at the end of the day, these are games where you fuck Aphrodite and her handmaidens compliment your form. The new GoW isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs quiet and intimate at times and the quest that Kratos goes on is not one of hate and anger, but one of love. Ultimately, Santa Monica was trying to distance this game from the others and especially distance the game from the toxic masculinity present in those first games. This is done in part by no focusing on player empowerment. Instead, Kratos is vulnerable. He feels more than just anger and goes through real struggle. This is where the camera comes in. In gameplay, the camera sticks to you, giving you a limited view. This leaves you open to attacks that are only indicated by the arrows. You are open, exposed, vulnerable. And this can make a player angry. But it‚Äôs supposed to. You cannot succeed until you accept the Kratos‚Äô vulnerability and embrace it. You feel like a god once you master the combat system, when you can quick turn and dodge just in time only by using the arrows and sounds. That is when the player feels empowered. When they learn to embrace and accept their vulnerability. 

I might be looking too deep into this, and I probably didn‚Äôt explain myself well, but I just needed to get this out. And if you disagree, that‚Äôs fine. I might just be a butthurt fanboy. Also, this was not meant to be me shitting on Mark Brown. I fucking love GMTK, I just disagreed with the guy‚Äôs opinion. 

Tl;dr The camera in GoW makes you feel vulnerable and that‚Äôs the point.",15,public,,1

For example, I just got the Shattered Gauntlet of Ages, but it's only a level 3 item. I'm almost level 5. The stats are all worse than the item I currently have.

Obviously being older, he would have some of them. Then there will be different puzzles where you would have to switch between Kratos and Loki, where Loki is the more agile and Kratos being the heavy lifter. Loki somehow tricks Kratos to go off with someone else and leaves him behind where you then take on the role of Kratos trying to get back to his son.

GodofWar,t3_bn5cao,"SPOILER - GOD OF WAR THEORY: LOKI IS A TIME TRAVELLER, AND TYR, THE GOD OF WAR. - SPOILER","First of all, I must say that I really believe in this theory. I have been discussing about God of War with my friend, and I may don't have all the questions, but I really think my theory do explain some things.

1- THE TIME TRAVELLING: In the norse mythology, Loki marries the Jotun(Giant) Angurboda, and with her, have three kids: Jormungandr, Fenrir and Hela. Wich two of them, are already present in the game. Jormungandr and possibly Hela. But how? Since the Giants are already all dead and Loki is a kid, how would all of this happen? It won't. Because it already did. Loki is a time traveler. Not the actual Loki that we see and play with, but a Loki in a soon, very soon future. That's why we already have Jormungandr, Fenrir and Skoll and Hati in the game, all of them being descendant of Loki. Because Loki travelled back in time, maybe with Jormungandr, I don't know. But when he did, he lived hundreds or maybe thousands of years before he even comes to existence. That's the reason why the Ragnarok is coming faster than predicted, and why Jormungandr recognized Atreus, because he is it's father.

2- TYR: During the game, we are hinted that Tyr is a God Of War that searched peace, which made us think that maybe Kratos was Tyr. But that was wrong. Like Atreus, Tyr always tried to help people and was good all along. According to the God of War fandom: **""T√Ωr is a Norse god associated with war and heroic glory in Norse mythology. He is typically described as only having one hand, having lost the other to the wolf** [**Fenrir**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir)**.""**. ( &lt;[https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/T√Ωr](https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/T√Ωr)\&gt; ) Tyr lost his arm to Fenrir. I can't explain why Fenrir would attack his own father, but it at least connects the two characters. According to the game, Tyr is one of Odin's sons. And that matches exactly with Loki. Loki is adopted, but is considered son of Odin. And that would explain why is Odin so obsessed with Kratos and Loki, sending Baldur after them. Maybe he already knows about it. In the Norse apocalypse, the Ragnarok, **""*****Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world"".*** *( &lt;*[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki)*&gt; ).*

&amp;#x200B;

What if Loki, the adult one, that travelled back in time is still alive?  We can see throughout the whole game, that the mother ALWAYS knew where Kratos would go, and what decisions he would make. Preparing the ground for Kratos, marking the way.  Maybe because she has hinted to do so. Maybe because there was someone, that already lived all of this, guiding her and helping her to create and accomplish a prophecy. Not because she saw the future, but because she had with her someone that LIVED it. Loki is the one that manipulated all of this, all of the story. I wouldn't expect nothing less from the God of Manipulation.

GodofWar,t3_bn3e1w,"Logically speaking, it doesn't make sense for Kratos to wield [spoiler weapon] over his far superior axe","I've seen discussions here mentioning that the players want to wield Thors hammer Mjolnir, either due to the Marvel Universe connection or the legendary mythological importance of the weapon 

But, as far as the game goes, it really wouldn't make much sense to wield the inferior weapon, considering the dwarves created the weapon with flaws that impeded the extent of Thors damage 

Some of the flaws are its incredibly unbalanced and heavy weight, the fact that mythologically the hammer requires a special belt just to wield it, its incredibly short handle meaning it has an extremely short attack reach and even the fact the weapon does not serve as a medium of creating thunder

You can argue the hammer is flawed only in part of its weight and short handle only but the Leviathan Axe was created in the hopes of equaling and even surpassing Mjolnir 

If anything, Surtrs Blade or Odins Spear would serve as better alternatives for weapons that Kratos could possibly wield in the future of the series",0,public,Spoilers,1
GodofWar,t3_bmy37q,Glitches during Muspelheim Surtr‚Äôs hidden time attack?,"This is about Surtr‚Äôs time attack challenge that unlocks with 3 keys. I‚Äôm on GMGOW. Sorry for this throw up of a post. I‚Äôm really caffeinated and a little turned up after finally coming so close to gold on this trial but being stopped by shit like this. 

So I‚Äôve recorded these events and will upload them later when I have the chance.  I‚Äôm under the current impression I take no damage during the time attack. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. 

- GLITCHES/EVENTS: 
- Glitches/events that have stopped me from completing the trial (come to 65 kills, each event/glitch caused 30 sec- 1 minute delay) 

 - Got hit with witch‚Äôs frozen breath - Kratos then froze still, a bunch of staggering animations occurred (with no hits on him) and I died. ressurected at full health somehow using berserker stone, was still for at least 20-30 seconds.

 - Twice now, around 2:30 minutes, a poison reaver stays inside the spawn point. One time it took me ages to kill him. (He had a shield. Felt like it took at least a minute.) Would not come out. I was definitely going to make it that time. 

 - The worm that burrows can not be knocked off the side. ( Haven‚Äôt recorded this but it simply will not happen.) I feel like this is intended. Unless stunned and execution thrown off the side. Anyone confirm? 

- Anyways, anyone struggling with this trial, the valk armor has yielded me the best results. I was going to make it to gold twice now if it wasn‚Äôt for these events happening. 3 times now I‚Äôve been stopped by this. I‚Äôve tried it with invaldi‚Äôs (my strength build), and Sindri‚Äôs (CD build) and a mix up of valk/Sindri, but valk‚Äôs unstoppable aura/tunic attack reset on kill/and runic blessing/with cd gems have turned me into a killing machine.

GodofWar,t3_bmtsgz,A scene I would like to see in the next GoW [spoilers?],"Imagine a scene where Kratos sends Thor and his hammer away from each other and our GoW picks up and begins to dual wield the Leviathan axe and Mjolnir. 

It would be amazing to see thunder surging through Kratos' body through the arm he is using to hold the hammer and the axe's blade would start to ice up (?) at the same time. Kratos would probably deliver some one-liner before kicking in Thor's shit and the surrounding environment until someone interrupts their fight (probably Odin or something).

This fight highlights how bad Axe throwing feels to me, which surprised me, having heard everybody rave about the axe return animation. Having a dedicated return button is tedious (I get why it's there, they use it for puzzles) - since it's on Triangle, you have to take your thumb off the aim stick each time - combined with all the RT/RB + LT/LB combinations, the controls feel like finger salad to me. It's surprisingly unintuitive for a mainstream AAA title. (Circle for interact? Is this a GoW staple?)

Unlike other games with skill trees, here it doesn't feel like a powerup, but like I have to work my way through half of it to become baseline useful in combat. For example, you can parry - but you need to buy an upgrade to actually follow it up with an attack.

You can do this at Niflheim and Muspelheim as long as you haven't already visited those realms before. Travel to one of those realms and pass through the first two doorways. This will give you a notification that you have received skap slag, and your inventory will have increased by 9 pieces. Restart checkpoint. You will keep the skap but be able to pass through the doors again for more. You can keep doing this as long as you want, as long as you never proceed to the next checkpoint. Once you've stocked up to your satisfaction, restart checkpoint again then travel back to Midgard. With this method you can get 9 pieces every 35-40 seconds.",39,public,,1

GodofWar,t3_bmn833,Idea for GOW 2,"Kratos and Thor have an epic battle, Kratos loses to Thor, both gods are on the brink of death, Kratos loses consciousness, Thor is still awake but in a bad shape and because of this he doesn't have the energy to kill a god.

After sensing the boy's godly presence, and realizing that Norse gods are now in short supply right before Ragnarok begins, Thor subdues Atreus (Loki) with magic and kidnaps him to train him as his apprentice. Thor brings Atreus to Odin to erase his memories of his past. Odin, being all-knowing, realizes that Kratos is a hard god to kill, seeing as he has killed; the entire Greek pantheon; Titans; many mythical beasts; 3 of the Norse gods; himself multiple times and returned, and almost killed Thor. Odin realizes that the only one who can kill Kratos for good, is his son. Odin uses his magic to trick  Loki into believing that Kratos is the demon prophesized to bring Ragnarok and destroy Valhalla.

Kratos is trapped in Midgard, fighting through the relentless hordes of Ragnorok to get to Valhalla-- this takes years.

In this time his beard shows some signs of aging.

He finally arrives and Loki is in his late teens/ early 20's, and after years of indoctrination and magic, he (literally) sees Kratos as the Norse equivalent of the Devil-- his appearance to Loki reflects that/ a different appearance to what we know Kratos to look like.

In the absence of his own sons, Loki grows on Thor and Thor thinks of him as his adopted son which is reciprocated by Loki-- there is a genuine and unspoken bond between them, like father and son.

Loki has the power of a young Kratos with a Norse twist, he is capable of using all of the powers of the Norse gods. He has a rage identical to that of Kratos, potent but uncontrolled and, reckless and psychopathic like Baldur.

Loki is much more powerful than Kratos, especially since Kratos is old and Loki is young.

Kratos kills Thor.

Arm needed to be forges by a god of war/healing so that he can regain his kingdom


„Äã„ÄãIn celtic myth you cant be king if your not 'whole'

truezelda,t3_caj665,"Follow up to previous thread weird idea, what if Demise is NOT dead and hylia is?","
&gt;&gt;TLDR point of this post/ theory is. To find a way to reconcile Hylias actions with the 3 goddess words, and figuring out whether she is alive and zelda, a dead mortal whos blood was passed on after she lost her godhood but not before Demise ate her divinity. Or whether she reascended after death. 

&gt;It will also look at whether or not demise kinda had a point to rise against a benevolant tyrant, or whether he decided to fight a vengeful queen/goddess, its implied both fucked up here Hylia created the cycle not Demise, it was his curse but she gave him the opportunity to steal her divinity when she became mortal, flesh and blood.
And the power to actually curse Link by using her strength/ Magic

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

How cool would it be to finally end Ganons cycle, in the most permamant way possible either destroying the Master Sword and forging a new sword purpose built for, Ganon and not Demise.

And because its a new much larger demon than demise was...What if it wasnt actually a sword... and was actually Ganons Trident of Power crafted to Destroy him, but instead he takes and corrupts it, his power reaching a new far greater level than OG Demise but not Divine Demise.

Also what if you had to Kill Demise to free the remnants of Hylias soul, or to destroy the curse for good

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

In SS demise seems to ascend to godhood during the final battle when he absorbs Hylia-Zelda, his hair turns into a Budhist Mandorla which is basically an Aura of !!!divine flame!!!.

Link cant even actually injure demise even though he is in a weakend form of his divine state, so to end the battle rather than killing Demise witha capital K, Link must weaken him by !!!!channeling thunder!!!! And than sealing him inside the Master sword. Silencing Fii forever, and dooming Hylia to !!!!death as a mortal!!!! Regardless of the bloodline she created.

She decided to become a mortal, and never actually mentioned gaining her divinity back. I also think Hylia betrayed the 3 golden goddess, by creating the Hylian Royal Family in the first place.

Din, farore and naryu created a balanced realm and left beind 2 objects to uphold said balance. 

The trifoce and Hylia, the PROTECTOR not WIELDER of the triforce, the bargain for her divinity was to explicitly NOT wield it, only humans were allowwed,


Her response? Creating an ubermencsh dedicated to holding a monopoly on the Triforce for all time, sure she seems benevolent, but the triforce can supercede the triforce... why not just unwish shit wishes and leave it for the humans like the goddesses originally wanted?..

And so I think the 3 goddess refused to give Hylia her divinity ---back due to her actions during the war.. that being said if we truly vanquished demise, would Goddess hylia get her soul back?

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

So if this the case, is demise not actually, alive? If say the Master sword was destroyed, would we see a Ghostbusters 2 situation? Where Demise is freed?

„Äã„Äã„ÄãCalamity ganons stay puft in the ghost busters analogy of course


I think Ganondorf basicaly built the gerudo crown in Demises image, or its a holdover from proto gerudo demon tribe.

Spikey mandorla to represent his ascent just as ganon hopes to, and the cold resist ruby to represent the cold deserts windy night he want to get his tribe away from.

Also anyone notice the Thunder helm is basicaly demise in helmet form? Spikeyc andorla, it can channel lightning/thunder , its the chief of the gerudos helmet NOT king, demise was cheif of the demon TRIBE until he conquered becoming a daimao

 yet they have queen (botw) and king(ganon) in modern time  

not a chieftan which means it must be old as fuck, say like when they were still tribal, and not royals.

truezelda,t3_ca8snt,What makes a Zelda game dark? Discussion question.,"With the announcement of BotW2, there‚Äôs a lot of discussion about the game being darker than its predecessors. But what makes a game ‚Äúdark‚Äù?

Is it spooky aesthetics and music? Downer endings and fridge horror? Individual tragic/heavy/horrific moments? Unanswered questions or environmental storytelling?

As an example, TP is often described as a dark Zelda game. But to my eye, it seems to be a pretty standard heroic story. There‚Äôs sad times (the death of the Zora queen, Midna‚Äôs parting), but in general things go right for the hero. Evil is overcome and things are set right by the end of the story.

By contrast, in OoT, the heroes‚Äô mistakes and failures cause untold suffering to the people of Hyrule, and, despite her efforts, Zelda can‚Äôt make it right again. She probably just makes it worse by trying.

So I guess for me, it‚Äôs the sad moments that get worse when you think about them too hard that make a game dark. Majora‚Äôs Mask isn‚Äôt just the hundred tragedies you encounter, but also your inability to fix them all in the time allotted.

Thank you nintendo for not making 5 DLCs for $20 each to milk us, although you probably know we‚Äôd definitely buy)

Edit 2; gerudo crown isnt just a piece of metal or gold. Its the gerudo cold resist or ruby circlet (ganon always complains of the cold night winds hint)  to survive the harsh desert nights.

With a halo attached to the back of the circlet gping through the hair like plaits or dreadlocks, HW ganon and BOTW2 ganon show this quite clearly.

Thunder helm is the same with a mask and possibly amber earrings intergrated into it.

Mindas crown (shes the queen remeber) has the same halo and circlet with chameleons poking out their tongues on the halo.

Zant has Gerudo imagery on his throne before ganon shows up and royal attire, aswell as a chameleon head helm complete with tongue

midna remarks they lost their OG king to greed, (triforce theif gang of ganondorf alttp)

truezelda,t3_c983vc,Zeldas that have used magic without the Triforce's aid,"SS- Zelda uses magic to send the Goddess' harp to Link 

MC- Creates a barrier. Maybe the Light Force makes Goddess Blood magic stronger similarly to the Triforce?

ALttP- Uses Telepathy and removes the barrier on Ganon's Tower

ALBW- Creates the Bow of Light

Zelda 1- not really sure if she uses the Triforce or her own power to break the ToW

FSA- Creates a sealing ball of light and doesn't seem to have the Triforce or it's not important as it's never mentioned iirc

ST- Uses magic in the final battle 

This makes me think if Zelda no longer has the Triforce in BotW 2 she can still use magic. It'll just be weaker.

Edit: FS and OoT Zelda have prophetic dreams which could count as magic and WW Zelda uses Light Arrows after the Triforce leaves the Great Sea. Thanks to u/Petrichor02 and u/GamerLeFay",109,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c99g6j,Shortest time between threats to Hyrule?,"As far as i know Zelda games take place hundreds if not thousands of years apart from eachother.

Could the BotW sequel be the shortest time between threats to Hyrule?  Lets say the events/battle that took place at the end of BotW happened 1 year before what we see in the trailer for BotW 2.  Based on the looks of Zelda, Link and even the small bit of landscape we saw, its possible less than 5 years have passed since that BotW ending battle. 

Would this even be significant? Whether or not its the quickest turnaround to a villian threatening Hyrule once again?  

For example OoT takes place, Child era timeline includes MM but lets ignore that because its not Hyrule. The time between OoT and TP (both include a major threat to Hyrule on same timeline) is ALOT like hundreds at the very least. If BotW 1 and BotW 2 are on same timeline (most likely) and less than 5 years have passed between ending of BotW 1 and BotW 2 (most likely) this could be the fastest a major threat to Hyrule has come to bother Link and Zelda since their previous battle.  

Am i missing something like Zelda 1 and Zelda 2? Im not too familair with those.

truezelda,t3_c96ko1,Favorite Individual Puzzle Mechanic?,What was your favorite puzzle in the entire Zelda series. Either literally the single puzzle or the the series of puzzles that lead up to the final solution. My favorite smaller puzzles are the simple lighting torches with arrows. Where you have to shoot through a fire to light a torch to open a door and all variations of those. Very simple but I feel like they define the series in a way. My other favorite was the Stone Tower Temple flipping mechanic in Majoras Mask.

Personally I would have to give my pick to the Skyview Temple from Skyward Sword. I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles and enemies, and I REALLY enjoyed getting the beetle and the freedom to explore all over the coves throughout the temple.

 Furthermore the boss (Ghiriham 1st battle) was actually challenging, and no 3d zelda has ever had a difficult 1st boss. And if he destroyed your shield like he did to me, then it made his charge attacks even harder to avoid. 

Woodall Temple from MM is a close second for me.",47,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c8rbfr,The internet is suddenly convinced that Lurelin Village is Outset Island,"I just want everyone's opinion on this.

I had always taken that the village was a homage to the Wind Waker location, alongside a Hawaiian/Polynesian aesthetic. You have an ocean lookout tower (more characteristic of a coastal settlement than anything Zelda specific, imo), a collection of houses vaguely in the same locations (alongside additional houses), a port/ocean dock, and an animal enclosure relatively around where you'd imagine Rose's pig enclosure. Geography isn't even a close match.

A curious easter egg would be that the upper floor of a house like Ocra's (location) is missing - in Wind Waker, Sturgeon's room. Instead, you have a flat rooftop with a Korok puzzle requiring a triangle of rocks, which requires Octorok Balloons and wind to place the missing rock. (vague interpretation: Sturgeon's big-bulbous head + wind)

\---

Now why bring this up? Everywhere I go, I see people saying this *is* Outset Island - not an Easter Egg, but rather evidence that we're either somewhere in the adult timeline, or that this is the same location under a different circumstance (attention being brought to Ranch Ruins/Lon Lon Ranch, specifically). Another is that these similarities between Lurelin and Outset are a brand new discovery - they're not (different youtube accounts, posters, etc are all claiming to have ""just discovered"" this, unprompted).

In addition, there's also suspicion that [the Dueling Peaks are what comes to be known as Outset Island in the Wind Waker](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/7dnemy/are_the_dueling_peaks_outset_island_other/). (super convincing, even with the lower-right/uncircled ""boulder"" being the start of Outset's port)

So I really want to fact/conscious check - do we generally believe that Lurelin is meant to be Outset Island, or is this a ""wrong""/casual/sensational take? And either way, do we believe some of these elements to be easter eggs directly pointing to Outset, or coincidence?",167,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c8v3ux,Agahnim is Phantom Ganon,"In the Downfall timeline, Ganondorf claimed the other two pieces of the Triforce, and transformed into the Demon King, but was sealed with the Triforce into the Sacred Realm by Zelda and the Six Sages.

Later, after adventurers entered the Sacred Realm and did not return, the King of Hyrule ordered the Seven Sages to seal the Sacred Realm. Despite demons leaving the Sacred Realm to attack them, they were successful, and the doorway to the Saccred Realm was closed once more.

At this point, Ganon is sealed into the Sacred Realm twice over - he couldn't leave it when the door was open, and people were entering all the time, and that door is shut. In order to break the seal, he needs to be in the Light World. To get into the Light World, he needs to break the seal. Following the second seal, he can't send demons out from the Sacred Realm to act as agents for him either. So his grand master plan to get out... is to send his alter ego to banish the descendants of Sages into the Dark World to weaken the seal? How did he manage to get his alter ego into the Light World to begin with?

Well, he does have one living demon he could send to do his bidding who isn't sealed into the Sacred Realm - Phantom Ganon.

Following the Hero of Time's victory over Phantom Ganon in the Forest Temple, Ganondorf banished it to The Gap Between Dimensions - and a portal opens up that sucks Phantom Ganon in. As that's going on, Ganondorf talks to Link, and acknowledges that Link is more skill than he thought, though when Link fights the real him, it'll be harder.

From this we know that:

1. Phantom Ganon isn't dead, but banished/sealed.
2. Phantom Ganon isn't sealed by the forces of good, but by Ganondorf.
3. Phantom Ganon was sealed into the Gap Between Dimensions.
4. Ganondorf is aware of what his Phantom interacts with
5. Ganondorf is capable of interacting with his Phantom from far away.

Seals in the Legend of Zelda can be broken with enough power (The Imprisoned, Ganon in WW backstory), by banishing the people powering the seal (Maidens in a Link to the Past, Sages in a Link Between Worlds), or by the person who made the seal letting it fail (Impa sealing Faron Woods to prevent the Sealed Temple from getting flooded in Skyward Sword, Zelda letting the seal on the Imprisoned go when the Triforce annihilated him).

So Ganon, needing to interact with the Light World, allows his seal on his Phantom to fall, and it would reenter the world from the place where it was sealed - in the Forest Temple, in the Light World. Phantom Ganon can comfortably be called an alterego of Ganon - fitting how Ganon describes Agahnim. Agahnim and Phantom Ganon have a similar fighting style too - involving lightning magic, teleporting around and clones.

Dunno, this a a lot of time on words spent on something that doesn't really matter, but I think it makes sense.

EDIT:

After Agahnim's second defeat, and Ganon flies back to his Pyramid - Agahnim's body doesn't disintegrate, but remains there. It's possible that he survived this defeat too, and after Ganon's defeath, and Link's Triforce wish, went into hiding to recover. Give it a few millennia to slip out of mind, he could then attempt to obtain the Triforce to regain Ganon's favour. 

Say, by demanding that Zelda tell her brother where the Triforce of Courage is located, and cursing her into an eternal slumber when she refuses, which finally kills the Phantom. 

Phantom Ganon is Agahnim is the Magician from Adventure of Link's backstory. Historia suggests that that Magician was another alterego for Ganon, but by that point on the Timeline, Ganon went insane eons ago. So, what if it was the same alterego constantly throughout the Downfall timeline?",32,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c8r6u0,I hope BotW2 will revise the traveling,"After making the [post about cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/c87kv2/i_hope_botw2_overhauls_the_cooking/), which spawned interesting discussions, here is another take how BotW2 could improve on the foundation of its predecessor. 

**Tl;dr:** Giving horses space to shine, making gliding an option with up- and downsides and transforming fast travel into a luxury good. Maybe making climbing more of a head-scratcher. 

---

#The current state:

**Horses** are severely outpaced by other traveling mechanics in various aspects. You get punished by not being able to traverse vertically in a world which constantly encourages it. The combat is harder and horses can die. The handling is comparably hard to control. Not to mention that you ""need"" to find good horses which you'll have to train at first. Not to mention that they can be easily separated from you and fast travel is always an option. Even mid-air. Then there is the vastly superior motorcycle... 

**Gliding** is so overpowered, it makes a lot of things  withing the game feel redundant (e.g. swimming and boats or shield surfing). The only limitations are your stamina and the availability of high ground. 


**Fast travel** is available from the beginning. The game is littered with fast travel points. Just undiscovered areas are typically traversed without it.

---

#How it could improve:


My take would be making **fast travel** only available to towns, towers (or something which replaces it) and other areas of interest. The travel medallion will be actually useful and rewarding to get. Maybe bundle a resource to the usage and make it a rewarding unlock. Make the fast travel animation interruptable by attacks and limit it's usage being on the ground.  


**The glider** could be overhauled as well. It can break just like bows and there are different types of gliders with up- and downsides (one out of wood which breaks fast but is light and doesn't use much stamina, a durable version etc.). The direction of wind could affect the gliding, similarly to the Deku leaf in TWW but not as much. And you can buy or find gliders in the world.  


If the changes to the other means of travel are made like above **the horses** are a more attractive choice for now. I would just make the steering more responsive and fighting and looting a little easier (kinda like TP).  


Maybe that is just me but **climbing** is a little overpowered as well. You rarely need to think about which route you'll take. I wouldn't mind if textures and angles were a bigger influence on it but you could climb in rain with better climbing gear.

truezelda,t3_c8spmf,World size vs World complexity,"So I‚Äôve been replaying breath of the wild the past couple weeks and one thing that stands out to me that I couldn‚Äôt quite place the first time through is how the sheer size of Hyrule is maybe a hinderance to the game.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm glad they went for such a giant map, but in future games I‚Äôm wondering if they should maybe scale it down in order to offer more complexity to the world. Having to fill so much space with things to do led to overabundances of weapons, food, etc. and NPC‚Äôs that felt very flat.

One example I can present is the process of buying and selling things from travelers or shops. When you can sell literally any item (in any amount) to any person in the world, it makes the whole process pointless. Additionally, you have to fill this giant world with things to do and collect, to the point that shops become pretty useless fairly early on for everything except maybe specialty arrows.

So do you guys think having a large world and a complex world are at odds with each other? If not how do you design a world that is both?",10,public,,0

This time lets include things from BotW too. What do you think needs to *not* come back (or at least take a very long break)?

[**Master Sword**](https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/536/5360430/3180644-nintendoswitch_tlozbreathofthewild_presentation2017_scrn14_png_jpgcopy.jpg)

I know this one is going to be controversial because it is so iconic but look at how new and fresh BotW felt when Link wasn't shown in a green tunic in all of the marketing material. I'd love to see more games that feature less of these kinds of elements, if it takes a new console game being set post-Wind Waker in a land other than Hyrule then I am all for it. Lets continue to shake things up

---

[**Guardians**](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/63MlZWgyBbc/maxresdefault.jpg)

At least the walking kind. I'd love to see some other types. After BotW I am sick of seeing them. I want to see some with different shapes that move in different ways. Ball shaped bouncing guardian? Log shaped rolling guardian? I'm sure they could do more. I also hope they change up the guardian encounter music. That same aggressive piano tune for every guardian encounter gets old fast.

---

[**The Twilight**](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda11/Walkthrough/HD20/024.jpg)

I love everything about the Twilight, I just feel that what we saw was wrapped up in a neat little bow in one game and doesn't really need to be explored further. I wouldn't mind minor appearances when appropriate (A game featuring the interlopers, or a game set after TP explaining the events of TP, etc) but I don't want the finality of the ending of TP ruined.

They could certainly make a new world with the same mood without actually using the Twilight again. I'm aware that the Twilight Realm exists in all three timelines but I feel like the impact of its weirdness would be lost if they were to keep using it.

---

[**Wind Waker's Artstyle**](http://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/52507/large.jpg)

For basically the same reason that I don't want the Twilight revisited I'd love for Wind Waker to be the only game to really use its artstyle. Wind Waker is beautiful (and Wind Waker HD looks even better, ^(fight me)) but I feel like it would lose its impact as a visually distinct game if others look like it. Some of the other games feature art that looks very similar but lets face it Phantom Hourglass does not look like Wind Waker, it has its own distinct look and feel. I'd love to see them go for an artstyle as unexpected and jarring as Wind Waker was again though!

I don't really want any of the artstyles re-used too much, one or two games per style is enough for me. I feel like after BotW's sequel I'll be sick of this style and ready for the next one too.

[**Breath of the Wild's Shrines**](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/thumb/6/64/BotW_Oman_Au_Shrine_Exterior.png/1200px-BotW_Oman_Au_Shrine_Exterior.png)

I would rather have 15 bigger and more unique dungeons than 120 identical shrines. If they do decide to do this kind of thing again then I hope that we get at least a little bit of variety in visual design for both the inside and outside of shrines. It's an interesting style for the first 50 mini-dungeons but by the time you enter your hundredth identical one it gets a little less exciting.

---

[**Humanoid Enemies**](https://nintendosoup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/legendofzelda_botw_ss_3-1038x576.jpg)

I know that the reason that most enemies wield weapons that Link can use in BotW is so that Link can replenish his inventory as he fights and keep a constant flow of new weapons moving through but **I feel like requiring any enemy that takes more than 1 hit to kill to be a weapon user really limited enemy/fighting style variety.** I miss Like Likes, Tektites, Leevers, Poes, Armos, Peahats, Skulltula, and other weird things like that!

If they did add more non-humanoid enemies then I think that the problem of weapon availability could be helped by increasing weapon durability 3x, and adding weapon shops in each town. Maybe also weapon upgrade/repair places? Would also give a use for rupees other than buying all of the arrows at every shop like everyone ended up doing in BotW.

truezelda,t3_c8lh3i,On the topic of Ganondorf's identity in the sequel.,"So I noticed in my previous thread that there were a lot of debate around whether or not Ganondorf in the sequel is a new Ganondorf or the same one from OoT. Regarding all the contention surrounding Ganondorf's identity; the evidence mends to both sides of the spectrum in classifying him as either the first Ganondorf, or potentially a new Ganondorf in a stalemated standoff that ultimately is a conundrum with current information.

The more palpable, and relatively more dominant, side are the assertions made by Creating a Champion; Calamity Ganon's inception to be of Gerudo origin, and states no other male Gerudo leader superseded this event to be considered a male Gerudo other than ""the king who became the Calamity"". Its a strong testimony to clamor to the identity of Ganondorf from OoT, but its also inherently problematic with other sources of cemented canon.

For starters, the Historia posits that Ganon by the time of TLoZ ""contains no trace of the thief Ganondorf"" which is under the extrapolation of endless resurrection. For all things considered, this is given viable substance by the portrayal of a hatred induced Ganon reverting back to Ganondorf on two separate occasions: Ocarina of Time's ending and Twilight Princess's battle with Dark Beast Ganon, but since it was constantly perpetuated the traits eventually dissipated until Ganon was the only thing remaining, and since BoTW adopts the same precedent would mean the same sequence follows, which it does IMO. However the critical error is that his human body is present in the sequel and this proceeds with a barrage of questions that challenges canonical integrity.

Its impossible to justify that any instance of where games that does explore Ganon's resurrections to be offshoot entities like a bunshin/separate soul/another body to be separate from his human body, because its well established that when Ganondorf defeated Link, obtained the entire Triforce, sealed away in the DW, was all done in the initial phase of him claiming the ToP in OoT as a human. This now begs the question as to how his human form is sustained if there is confirmation with applicable evidence to say that it vanished after millennia.

Suffice to say, it needs to be reminded that since BoTW's continuity is being propelled by the  cycle of Link, Zelda, Ganon and features a backstory that no game previously explored with that motif intact to define the series main narrative--*that has never happened until BoTW*\--elicits possibilities/loopholes, which leverages scenarios that may be considered unprecedented. For example, one such unprecedented loophole comes in the form of Zora's Domain. Its mentioned in-game that Zora's Domain was constructed 10,000 years ago in ""the History of the Zora pt.I"" and it further alludes to the Zora's Domain of OoT in ""the History of the Zora pt.V"". The absence of contextual rention in conveying a sequential relation between the Zora's Domain pre-BoTW, with the Zora's Domain of OoT incites continuity negligence and can instigate that they are the same domain (since the tone of pt.I heavily implies the initial creation of Zora's Domain). However, the reader would ultimately have to deduce by way of cross-references that they are different domains, which is indeed confirmed by Creating a Champion as the Zora's Domain spoken of in pt.I was built in BoTW's preliminary ""era of prosperity"" over 10,000 years ago.

The same kind of continuity negligence can apply to Ganondorf in the sequel, despite the indication of Ganondorf I becoming the Calamity; he is consistently resurrected over the course of eons and would lose all traces to Ganondorf, yet there is no withstanding explanation as to how his human body is preserved. Thus, the only overarching rationale adequate enough to explain this is that the Ganondorf in the sequel, although still abides by the main narrative of the series, must be one applicable to BoTW's own realization of the cycle (similar to how the game is seemingly poised to insinuate the initial creation of Zora's Domain to have happened after OoT). This realistically would have to be an event that precedes the era of prosperity listed in Creating a Champion's historical flowchart, but after the era of myth. One that leaves Ganondorf in a precarious state that's desperately trying to reconfigure a body through malice, but is repeatedly thwarted by the hero and the princess time after time again, ala BoTW's own take on the cycle.

Nevertheless, all of this still invariably harks back in turmoil with the iron clad statement of Ganondorf I became the Calamity because no other male Gerudo rose, which conflicts with the Historia's statement that ""traces to Ganondorf have completely subsided"" (with relative insight by OoT and TP on the matter), which makes the argument a conundrum and me wholeheartedly neutral on the subject.  One thing is for certain though: One or the other is getting severely retconned by the time of the game's release.

truezelda,t3_c87kv2,I hope BotW2 overhauls the cooking.,"I think the basic idea of the cooking in BotW is actually quite nice. The individual ingredients and how to throw them into the pot... This usually looks so delicious! I also like how you take the ingredients in your hand, how cooking pots are used and how even elements and temperatures have an influence on the ingredients. Really well done! At first sight a great and innovative game-mechanic, but overall I was a bit disappointed by the implementation and how the cooking is integrated into the game as soon as I played the game a bit more. 

The cooking system punishes experiments and motivates to cook the same simple dishes that are most effective over and over again. Tasty combinations and proper dishes like nut cake, vegetable risotto, cr√™pe and mushroom omelet are harder to make, but have hardly any mechanical value. One reason for this is that ingredients such as butter, egg, salt and cane sugar are not just rarer, but are of little use as well. In addition, you have to remember some combinations. But why this extra effort if it doesn't really help you in the adventure? Other ingredients that are much easier to find, combine and more useful in battle can be found very easily anyway.

Of course the cooking mechanics are also involved with the inventory, which I'm not really a fan of either. Since you can collect an infinite number of ingredients and they are easy to find, the game motivates me to fill the bags up as much until I'm getting bored, then go to the cooking pot and cook 10 boring minutes according to the same pattern until the inventory is full.

I hope in BotW2 they will improve on this. This means more complex recipes, experiments are rewarded and the addition of a cookery book in which found recipes are automatically filled and you can also add your own creations (similar to melodies in OoT/MM). Also a limitation of ingredients you can take and if necessary a better distribution of those within the world. It wouldn't be bad if you could build cooking pot as well alongside the campfire. Together with an inventory overhaul and a realtime consume-animation for Link like in Skyward Sword, this would be really great.

In short, whoever programmed, designed and how the cooking is controlled should be proud of themselves. Also the visualizations etc. are all very nice and innovative. However, the game-designers which implented the cooking as game logic into the overall game should be banished into the well of Kakariko.",257,public,,0

The strangeness of the location and the characters really helped Koholint feel like a fully realized world with some things that you just didn‚Äôt need to fully understand to appreciate.

Years later, learning that this was a nod to an obscure game (For Frog the Bell Tolls) that shared some engine/UI aspects with LA, made the reference all the deeper and more interesting.

truezelda,t3_c7sr3j,A YouTube Zelda theory that actually has some merit?,"I'm not generally one to invest ANY kind of stock into Zelda theories in the form of YouTube videos; a majority, if not all, of them are too superficial, relies on circumstantial evidence, and just overall posits an unsubstantiated premise in a way that makes the person ultimately oblivious to the subject matter. It's become such an incessant repetition to the point where I've become very desensitized to YouTube theories on Zelda lore. Despite this though, I came across a video in my feed yesterday that defied my expectations and honestly left me commending the effort, I'd like to share it with you all and see how receptive you are to its proclamation:

&amp;#x200B;

**\*My Thoughts\***

&amp;#x200B;

Even though it does have corroborative sound evidence, the premise still falls into the ""too superficial line of thought"" for me to vehemently give it a second ponder, and is directly and easily challengeable on two major fronts I've specifically made in a comment on:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*It's a well thought out theory with substantial evidence no doubt, but I think that a simpler explanation would be more safer to purport than what could be considered circumstantial. I mean the premise to this (Ganondorf's spirit powering Sheikah technology by way of a sophisticated filtering process) sounds pretty ostensible and leads me to question it on two major fronts:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Master Works on pg.75 does acknowledge that the incorporeal form of Ganon that enshroud Hyrule Castle is a spiritual body formed from coalesced malice, which implies that the malice is but an extension of his spirit that when augmented enough can assume his image in the form of an apparition. There are examples of this in both Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess, in which Demise's ""residual consciousness""  is in a docile state, but if left unchecked, can more than likely restore his physical form, ergo, it had to be sealed away. In Twilight Princess, a similar scenario involving what both the game and the Historia specifically refers to as his malice assumes Ganondorf's image, and Ganondorf himself stated that the hatred and agony of the Twili awakened him in this state and ultimately fostered his resurrection. We even witness that when his body as Ganon is destroyed he reverts back to this state, which would further denote that malice is but an extension of his spirit that can assume his image. In this video, there isn't a given explanation as to why his spirit would be represented as being the color green, other than the description of the Luminous Stones (which I honestly think is an urban legend that bases this assumption on that of the color of Luminous Stones matching the aura of spirits, but Zora's Domain was built from Luminous Stones and they don't in the least acknowledge the presence of spirits in their domain) when in the case of Twilight Princess the aura of his spirit is far different from the aura--which is also greenish--of other spirits encountered in the game.*

&gt;*2. The Sheikah are the emissaries of Hylia. The blue resonance of the  Sheikah, that would later go on to be the catalyst of Sheikah technology, are what are likely to be constituent of Hylia's own power because they were chosen specifically by her to be her guardian in Skyward Sword in an era where no humans other than the Sheikah could use magic--its comparable to how A Link to the Past states Hylians are chosen by the gods and its because of that designation they were able to use magic--Sheikah Monk Oman Au even addresses this by saying they are ""blessed with the sight of Goddess Hylia"". Moreover, it is demonstrated that they have access to this blue-oriented type of magic in Skyward Sword:*

&gt;  
&gt;*In addition to that, the Sheikah known as Cado in Kakariko Village remarks that Sheikah technology had once been praised as "" the technology of the gods"" strengthens this notion. As far as how this energy is collectively molded into crystalline objects that generates, supply, and converts energy into technology could honestly be something as arbitrary as Gratitude Crystals (the side quest items used to transform Batreaux in Skyward Sword) mysteriously forming from fulfilling good deeds.*

Still though, it is pretty well construed for a Zelda theory on YouTube--more so than any other theory video that I've ever encountered--I suppose that the reason why I think it may have more merit than other selective theories is because of how scarce information revolving around the sequel is, and how cohesive the exhibited evidence is presented (even if the premise is pretty easily refutable.)

truezelda,t3_c80ufq,(Hyrule Warriors) How could Lana/Cia be rewritten or re-conceptualized to feel less out of place in a real Zelda game?,"So, a buddy of mine and I have been playing Hyrule Warriors on Switch and got into it over whether or not the original characters were any good. We agreed Volga was okay (if only because he's basically a humanized OoT monster) but Lana and Cia were obviously a big sticking point because of their importance to the plot. I've always believed that people should try to provide constructive criticism to things they dislike, so I finally went ahead and decided to see how the Internet could do it.

Rule One: Be sincere. No ""Ganondorf kills them both lawl"" garbage.

truezelda,t3_c7ljhw,A BotW2 Trailer Detail That Might Prove Useful For Speculation,"I dont have a major ""ah ha, X is gonna happen!"" From this, but I'd figure I'd point it out incase we missed it. 

The moment where Hyrule Castle is raising up, the castle is fully built (you can see all the peaks on the top, vs in game the top left is broken). Which suggests time travel like some people have been specualting.

However, if it was time traveling to the time before the castle was destroyed, we'd see the whole town. The landscape matches the field like present day BotW. 

So since the end game, they spent resources on repairing the castle.",160,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c7l2qn,"What's a Zelda side quest that should have happened, but it didn't?","The Legend of Zelda has always had side quests to some extent. You can do a mini side quest in the first game to get potions; Link's Awakening introduced a proper side quest structure; and Majora's Mask basically weaponized them into a full game. Along with that, each game typically does a very good job at letting the player know that a side quest might be brewing, either by talking to NPCs or just through natural progress. Sometimes, though, ideas in Zelda never really manifest. 

I always found it disappointing that Twilight Princess didn't have one more side quest in its Castle Town (TP in general just needed more meaningful side content.) The Wind Waker pulled off so many little side quests in Windfall Island and Twilight Princess basically only gives you Agatha, Jovani, and Malo Mart. Which was all meaty, mind you, but that's just the problem. There are no little quests in-between to spice things up. 

I should make my next Zelda articles about how side quests have changed throughout the series. That'd be a fun way to look at the franchise.",32,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c7ov54,New Forms of Old Spirits (The Sages),"In Twilight Princess, the Ancient Sages look like [ghastly spirits](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeldadungeon.net%2FZelda11%2FWalkthrough%2FHD20%2F013.jpg&amp;f=1). These would match the themes of the [Sages from Ocarina of Time](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FVFrEOULyArA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;f=1), but at this point in the Child Timeline, would the Sages from OoT even be ""awakened"" as Sages? The Ancient Sages seem to be some kind of remnant or spirit form, as if their physical form withered away. The spirit forms are humanoid, elderly males. Remember, Rauru would be the only Sage we see in OoT with no physical form, outside of Kaepora Gaepora (the Owl). His form in the Chamber of Sages is also that of a humanoid old man, like the TP Ancient Sages. Are the Ancient Sages the real 'essence' that is inside most Sages?

The same way Link has the ""Spirit of the Hero"" that gets passed from Link to Link, these ghost spirits are a visual representation of ""Spirits of the Sages"". Link seems to always have the Spirit of the Hero, despite bloodlines and absences in history, so I assume the Spirits of the Sages are passed into every new group of Sages. These Sages, similar to the Hero, are in a cycle and appear to aid the Hero or aid in warding of evil, when the time comes.

In the backstory of ALttP, the OoT Sages were the Wise Men, referring to the spirits (as seen in TP), not the actual Sages (this was changed in the GBA release anyways). When the Maidens from ALttP are described as ""descendants"", despite questionable biology between species ^((Goron -&gt; human? Zora -&gt; human?)), it most likely means they have the ""Spirits of the Sages"". The same can be said about the Sages in ALBW, with the 7th Sage no longer going to Zelda. Instead of actual descendants, they are simply **successors**. This works in the other timelines as well, with FSA Sages and the two Sages in WW.

{This may even be the case for the 7(or 8?) Heroines from Breath of the Wild}

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Spirits of Sages are passed down throughout time to the next generation of Sages/Maidens, similar to Link's 'Spirit of the Hero'. Without a physical form, the Sages appear like they do in TP.

truezelda,t3_c7j0bu,Question: Am I the only one here that doesn‚Äôt care about the LoZ timeline?,"I‚Äôve played all main line Zelda games aside from the Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. I love the series and I love each game individually. Majora‚Äôs Mask and Link Between Worlds are my favorites. Perhaps that information fits into my opinion on this topic. 

To me, each game is unique, and while they all share similar characters, themes, items, and geography, I don‚Äôt particularly care if they all tie together in some way. I think the timeline was sloppily thrown together anyways. 

Forcing each new game to fit into this odd timeline means that we may be missing out on some truly great ideas and experiences that may be totally different than what we expect from a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Zelda game. 

I just want the developers to make the next Zelda game with dungeons, puzzles, items, cool side characters, and a unique narrative. If that doesn‚Äôt happen to fit into the timeline, I‚Äôm completely fine with that. I don‚Äôt want a game to have to involve the triforce, Ganon, or any of the other classic Zelda tropes that we‚Äôve grown accustomed to. I just want our next LoZ game to be the best it can be, no matter what the setting or even if it fits into the timeline at all. 

What do you all think?

Edit: People are getting downvoted simply for saying the timeline is unnecessary or that it doesn‚Äôt add anything to the series. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs very becoming of this sub. Stating an unpopular opinion in a respectful way should not equal downvotes. Come on, people.

Edit 2: There are some really elitist people on here who are extremely condescending because they have a different point of view than you do. I joined this sub because I wanted to actually discuss Zelda topics and themes instead of simply seeing paintings and things like that on other Zelda related subs.... I‚Äôm sure that not everyone on here is like that, but those few drive people away. My first post on here and I‚Äôm already contemplating unsubbing just because people are saying things like ‚ÄúI know this must come as a great shock to you.‚Äù I‚Äôd rather not deal with pretentious people when discussing a series that is my favorite series of all time.

truezelda,t3_c78ycs,The mathematics of A Link Between Worlds' flexible dungeon order (mild spoilers),"A Link Between Worlds is one of the first Legend of Zelda games to give the player more choice as to the order in which they complete dungeons.

Beginning with Hyrule: There are four dungeons in Hyrule that are accessible before Link reaches Lorule: Eastern Palace, House of Gales, Tower of Hera and Hyrule Castle.

The math for this part of the game is simple: There is only one dungeon the player can do to begin with, the Eastern Palace. From there they can choose to do either the House of Gales or the Tower of Hera. Only after all these dungeons are completed, can the player access Hyrule Castle. That means that so far, there are two possibilities in regard to player choice.

However, upon entering Lorule calculations get a little more complex. There are seven dungeons in Lorule: Skull Woods, Thieves' Hideout, Ice Ruins, Dark Palace, Swamp Palace, Turtle Rock and Lorule Castle. Additionally, the player can also access the Desert Palace in Hyrule via Lorule.

There are two catches that make calculations more complex: Firstly, Lorule Castle must be completed last. Secondly, the player cannot complete the Desert Palace before Thieves' Hideout as they need to complete Thieves' Hideout to gain access to the Sand Rod. So, the player must complete Thieves' Hideout before Desert Palace.

To calculate how many different orders in which the dungeons can be completed, the calculation needs to be split into two parts: Dungeons completed before Thieves' Hideout, and dungeons complete after.

Firstly, say the player chooses Thieves' Hideout as their first dungeon: That means that given this particular route, there are 2 x 1 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 = 1440 different possibilities. (The extra 2 at the start is for the previous calculations. The extra 1 on the end is to signify Lorule Castle.)

If the player chooses to do Thieves' Hideout second: 2 x 5 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 = 1200

Third: 2 x 5 x 4 x 1 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 = 960

Fourth: 2 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 = 720

Fifth: 2 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 1 = 480

Sixth: 2 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 = 240

Adding all these together: 1200 + 960 + 720 + 480 + 240 = 5040

I don‚Äôt care too much for BotW‚Äôs story due to many factors but one major part is the fact that the memories (or cutscenes) could be found in any order. 

For me, this made the plot more confusing as I never knew what was the order of events and/or the fact that pivotal scenes of character development could be found before characterization really even happens. Basically the pacing is all messed up and the flow is ruined.

So for BotW 2, I feel that story missions would have to be have some kind of structure to them to make it flow much better. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean the actual gameplay of story missions does not need to be overtly linear. You might just have to reach a goal let‚Äôs say but it‚Äôs up to you on how to get there. 

Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a open ended dungeon like Hyrule Castle that you can do in many ways but once you beat the boss at the end, the plot progression or cutscene occurs then. To simply, gameplay would not change much but you have a goal and you have the do the missions in a general order. Perhaps you could also choose to do several missions in any order you want as long as it does not significantly effect the flow of the story.",19,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c78ikw,I am confused... I thought Zelda and Link weren't reincarnated?,"As the title states, I am confused.

I recently made a post on the Zelda reddit page that states Link and Zelda do not reincarnate, pointing out evidence from the games. Then, someone said this was wrong, with.... proof.  ‚ÄùIn every age where Ganon rises up to cause chaos, there are born two defenders fated to protect the kingdom: a warrior with the soul of the hero and a sacred princess who is the goddess reborn.‚Äú (p.366 Creating a Champion) .

Whenever I played it when I was younger, I'd also swap over to the Biggoron Sword or Hammer to bypass his counters and blocks. 

On my latest playthrough, however, I decided to just stick with the Master Sword in spite of how often Dark Link blocks your attacks. Honestly, I had way more fun struggling through the fight as intended than I did trying to get around the sword fight. The longer the fight goes on, the more Dark Link drops his guard. He actually starts to get sloppy, giving YOU the opportunity to punish him in return. 

It's entirely possible that he uses the first half of the fight to learn your play style so he can mirror it (inevitably leading to imperfections,) but either way it was an interesting progression I hadn't noticed before. 

It made it an infinitely more satisfying showdown and it's absolutely going to be the way I fight him moving forward.

truezelda,t3_c6tslp,[TP] Midna's Relation to Vaati,"I finished Twilight Princess HD today (beat the game already long ago), and I noticed something quite interesting.  We all know Midna's helmet has the same eye on the front as the Majora's Mask.  Many people, myself included, have used this to theorize that the Dark Interlopers (ancestors of the Twili) and the dark tribe who created the Majora's Mask were one and the same.

However, I was very surprised to see that sitting on Midna's helmet behind her hair is Vaati's eye from FS and FSA.  Obviously now that we have the official timeline, we know that FSA is the sequel to TP on the timeline, so the two are connected (if only chronologically, although Hyrule Historia has interesting things to say about the mirror).  But in-universe, Vaati himself goes way back to TMC.  What is he doing on Midna's helmet?  It isn't just his eye at the end of MC; he plasters that eye *everywhere* in MC.

I have a couple of hypotheses.  I'm not convinced by any of them, but I was wondering if you guys had some further insight.

*Hypothesis 1*: The Dark Interlopers were Picori.  A very interesting hypothesis as it also explains the absence of the Picori post-TMC.  Perhaps Vaati himself made Midna's future helmet before he was sealed in the Four Sword.  The problem, of course is that the Twili are not anything like the Picori.  Perhaps the twilight changed them though?  Or even Vaati's magic?

*Hypothesis 2*: The (probably just some) Picori made the Majora's Mask and Midna's Helmet, but they were not the Dark Interlopers.  This explains why the Twili are so different from the Picori, but it also means the Dark Interlopers and the dark tribe who made the mask must be separate.

*Hypothesis 3*: It's just an Easter egg.  The thing no Zelda fan wants to hear and the answer I would hate the most.  There is no connection between the two eyes (Majora's Mask's and Vaati's) and any canon lore.  Nintendo just threw that in, like the Skyward Sword poster in Malon's room in OoT3D.  Say it isn't so!

Regardless of the hypothesis, it makes things difficult because I struggle to see how the Majora's Mask eye is relevant to lore but Vaati's eye isn't.  You can't just pick and choose like that, right?

truezelda,t3_c5unq9,"Unpopular opinion: I don't like Zelda dungeons, sadly","It's not that I find them to be a hindrance to the actual game design, but I find them to be very slow.  I don't mean this in a bad way, because it's a nice change of pace from exploring the world outside, but something about solving puzzles in the dungeons make me feel stressed and impatient, like I just want to get out of there already. I've tried to enjoy them, but I just feel a similar amount of anxiety/stress that I get when writing a college essay. Being in a dungeon feels like I'm trapped inside a coffin stuck 10 feet underground, and that I need to cleverly find a way out to survive.

On the other hand, I actually loved the shrines. While they were short and simplistic on the most part, the amount of freedom it gave to the player to solve the puzzle was pretty satisfying (although the repetitive tests of strength annoyed me). Additionally, they were completely optional, and I didn't feel any pressure when finishing all 120 of them. I think the Fateful Stars shrine was probably my favorite, because it made my dumbass feel like I had a 300 IQ after struggling to solve it. While the outdoor shrine quest riddles were pretty straightforward, they all felt rewarding to solve and made me feel smarter than I actually am.

I think the Divine Beasts were a nice spin on the dungeon formula visually, but they were pretty bland and felt devoid of anything challenging. However, I did love Hyrule Castle, and I'm hoping that the sequel will have dungeons that grant the same amount of freedom and detail that the castle did. While many would probably disagree, I'm hoping that they would give you the option to go straight to the boss in each dungeon, because I feel like it would alleviate a lot of stress off of my mind that I get from dungeons in the past games.

I don't think the dungeons are objectively bad, but they usually make me feel overwhelmed and give me a headache from the amount of backtracking and thinking I have to do to navigate myself to the boss room. It's pretty unfortunate, because I know a lot of people love the dungeons, but I just can't get myself to enjoy them because they just hurt my brain. I guess I'm just not the brightest, and that I gain more enjoyment in feeling smart than actually BEING smart.

They succeeded on many occasions but eventually fell once they were brought under the sway of the Calamity. Now that we destroyed Calamity Ganon shouldnt his control of them be overridden and have them turn back to our side? 

Having the Guardians still be enemies in BotW2 would undermine a huge part of the story of BotW1 where the Hyrulian forces lost BECAUSE of the Calamities sway on the Guardian Tech making them turn on the Hyrulian forces. They are the reason Hyrule Town was destroyed and why Link fell 100+ years ago. 

I propose than now instead of them being enemies we could have them be occasional helpers.

truezelda,t3_c4y72f,The Witch Behind the Curtain ‚Äì A Summary and Theory of the Gerudo,"Of all the races in the Zelda series, I can easily say the Gerudo are my top favorite. Everything about them is steeped in mystery ‚Äì their physiology, their history, even their icons of worship. I‚Äôve always wondered why they‚Äôre so mysterious and why they appear to have a particularly dark side despite the fact that most Gerudo are quite friendly and resentful of the likes of Ganondorf. Upon looking at their appearances and references in OoT, FSA, TP and BotW, I think I‚Äôve come up with an overarching answer to all Gerudo riddles.

&amp;#x200B;

But first, let‚Äôs talk about them in a general sense. The Gerudo are a nomadic race that reside in the desert regions of Hyrule. At different points in their history they‚Äôve lived in the [Gerudo Highlands](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/1/19/Yigaclanhideout.png/revision/latest?cb=20170514053648), the Gerudo Desert, and [places somewhat in-between](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/b/b6/FSA-GerudoVillage.jpg?version=84fbe321edcf821520afc045d5f79c4a). During our introduction to them back in the Age of Myth (aka the Era of the Hero of Time), they were found in Gerudo Valley and were ruled by Ganondorf. In those days, it was said that a single Gerudo male was born every 100 years, and this male would be crowned king according to Gerudo tradition. But how and why did this tradition start in the first place? To answer those questions, we may have to look at when the tradition ended:

&gt;*‚ÄúThe Gerudo are a proud nation of women.* ***They give birth exclusively to females*** *and only allow women into their capital, Gerudo Town. It is a long-held belief that men only bring disaster. However,* ***long ago it is said that a boy was born to the Gerudo tribe every one hundred years*** *and, per tradition, became King of the Gerudo.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It is written that Calamity Ganon once adopted the form of a Gerudo and, since he was the rare male born to the Gerudo, was made king. But that wasn‚Äôt enough for the man known as Ganondorf. He plotted to seize control of all of Hyrule and became the Great King of Evil. The only person standing in the way of his machinations was a young man with the soul of the hero who wielded the Master Sword. His plans shattered, Ganondorf lost control, and his powers consumed him, transforming him into the Dark Beast Ganon. After being defeated by the hero, he was sealed away by Princess Zelda and the other sages. His hatred of the hero and the princess is legendary. He revived again and again, only to be sealed many times over. Eventually, the Demon King Ganon became hatred and malice incarnate, holding a deep grudge against Hyrule itself.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*According to Gerudo records* ***there has not been another male Gerudo leader since the king who became the Calamity.****‚Äù* ‚Äì Creating a Champion, pg. 401

So it appears that after Ganondorf was sealed by Zelda and the sages, the Gerudo women began to rule themselves through the establishment of their own royal family. And by the time BotW happens, the Gerudo no longer give birth to males every 100 years. It‚Äôs easy to see why their leadership traditions changed, but what‚Äôs the explanation for the lack of males being born every 100 years? It couldn‚Äôt have been because Ganondorf was sealed, because his very birth is a result of the ‚Äúone male born every 100 years‚Äù phenomenon. Could it have been due to evolution? Maybe, but Gerudo physiology has barely changed between OoT and BotW. At most, prolonged mating with Hylian males has caused their eye color to shift from yellow to green and their ear shape to shift from round to pointed. This suggests that increased Hylian genetics is, of course, causing the Gerudo to become more similar to Hylians. Since the Gerudo have stopped giving birth to males entirely, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for their increased Hylian genes to be the cause, unless someone can point me to a case where Hylians are incapable of giving birth to males. So if it‚Äôs not Ganondorf and it‚Äôs not genetics, what else changed between OoT and BotW that could‚Äôve been linked to the male births? Well, many have pointed out that the nature of male Gerudo births doesn‚Äôt seem natural ‚Äì if anything it seems to be more in line with a curse or some other sort of magic. With that in mind, have any sources of magic been removed from the Gerudo between OoT and BotW?

&amp;#x200B;

You‚Äôve probably guessed it by now, so let‚Äôs talk about the Killa Grannyz: ~~Sexy Thermo Hexy~~ Twinrova.

Koume is described as the Sorceress of Flame, while Kotake is described as the Sorceress of Ice. Both are said to be Ganondorf‚Äôs foster parents, and according to Koume and Hyrule Historia the witches are 400 years old (although Kotake tries to say she‚Äôs 380 years old, but even if that were true, we could just round it up).

&gt;*""It could be said that the sisters, who have lived for over four hundred years, rule the tribe from behind the scenes.""* ‚Äì Hyrule Historia, pg. 90

But wait, the latter part of that HH statement is pretty interesting, and very significant. It also makes perfect sense given what we know of the Gerudo so far. There‚Äôs a lot of evidence pointing towards the idea that the Gerudo are not an evil or dark race. Although they were originally described to us as thieves, most of the individuals we meet in OoT, FSA and BotW are quite friendly. Nabooru, someone who was respected by all Gerudo, hated Ganondorf and everything he stood for:

&gt;*‚ÄúFirst of all, let me introduce myself. I'm Nabooru of the Gerudo. I'm a lone wolf thief. But don't get me wrong! Though we're both thieves, I'm completely different from Ganondorf. With his followers, he stole from women and children, and he even killed people! A kid like you may not know this, but the Gerudo race consists only of women. Only one man is born every hundred years... Even though our laws say that lone male Gerudo must become King of the Gerudo, I'll never bow to such an evil man!‚Äù* ‚Äì Nabooru (Ocarina of Time)

In FSA, the Gerudo express much discontent when they learn that Ganondorf broke into the Pyramid and stole the Trident. Even the Red Maiden can‚Äôt comprehend the idea of anyone in Gerudo society being an evil king of darkness:

&gt;*""The Gerudo honor the desert. They are trustworthy and pure of heart. I cannot imagine one of them is the King of Darkness...""* ‚Äî Red maiden (Four Swords Adventures)

Based on dialogue we receive in OoT, any evil the Gerudo did partake in, including following Ganondorf, was the result of manipulation and brainwashing that was spearheaded by Twinrova:

&gt;*""When Nabooru was a lone wolf thief, she never stole from the weak, but... Now, Nabooru's gang of thieves stands for cruelty and brutality. She claims to be a chivalrous robber, but...no way!""* ‚Äî Carpenter (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúThe leader of the gang of thieves is Nabooru. She is experimenting in brainwashing many people at the ruins in the desert.‚Äù* ‚Äì Carpenter (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúBy the way... I really messed up... I was brainwashed by those old witches and used by Ganondorf to do his evil will...‚Äù* ‚Äì Nabooru (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúLike I suspected, Nabooru was brainwashed by Ganondorf's followers...‚Äù* ‚Äì Sabooro (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúOh, it was Ganondorf the Evil King who was behind the gang of thieves...‚Äù* ‚Äì Ichiro (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúWithout the old witches, the gang of thieves isn't all that scary!‚Äù* ‚Äì Shiro (Ocarina of Time)

So, we can definitively say that the witches were using their magic to brainwash people into following Ganondorf. I would even argue that the witches were the reason that Gerudo and Hylian people were at odds during and before OoT. But this leads to a few more questions: Why would they try so hard to build up an army of followers for Ganondorf? How did they acquire the magic to brainwash people in the first place? And if you go with my theory, why would the witches try to isolate the Gerudo from Hyrule?

These are a lot of questions to answer, but we can tackle them by going off on a tangent: How did Ganondorf know precisely how to get into the Sacred Realm? He knew exactly where each Spiritual Stone was, given his precise attacks on each of the races who had them. He seemed to know exactly who had the Ocarina of Time, given his sudden interest in befriending the Hyrulean Royal Family and his instantaneous attack on Hyrule Castle when he realized his plans were falling apart. He also knew that the Composer Brothers could give him information on the Song of Time, and he knew how to use the Stones, Ocarina, and Song of Time to access the Sacred Realm:

&gt;*""Seeking the three Spiritual Stones necessary to open the gateway to the Sacred Realm, he carried out his plots in secret, in every corner of the land.""* ‚Äì Hyrule Historia pg. 84  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúOn that day seven years ago, Ganondorf suddenly attacked... and Hyrule Castle surrendered after a short time. Ganondorf's target was one of the keys to the Sacred Realm...the hidden treasure of the Royal Family...The Ocarina of Time!‚Äù* ‚Äì Impa (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúThough we never could figure out the power of the Triforce, we had almost completed our study of controlling time with the tones of ocarinas. Uh, I mean... Actually, we did complete that study! We would have been famous, if that hateful Ganondorf had not tried to steal our results. We could never let him reap the fruits of our research!‚Äù* ‚Äì Composer Brothers (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúGeh heh heh! Excellent work! As I thought, you held the keys to the Door of Time! You have led me to the gates of the Sacred Realm...‚Äù* ‚Äì Ganondorf (Ocarina of Time)

It‚Äôs doubtful the King of Hyrule openly told Ganondorf all the juicy details on how to acquire the Triforce, and there don‚Äôt appear to be many individuals outside of the Royal Family and the Sheikah who possess such knowledge. It‚Äôs possible he gained this knowledge through interrogation or brainwashing of someone who did know, but we haven‚Äôt heard any stories of a Sheikah or Royal Family member being put in such a position. I think, once again, we have to point the finger at Twinrova.

The witches clearly have been alive longer than the average Gerudo, so it‚Äôs safe to assume that they‚Äôre using magic to prolong their lifespan. Actually, although I don‚Äôt like Hyrule Encyclopedia, HE does support this:

&gt;*""Kotake and Koume, about four hundred years old at the time of Ganondorf's rise, are said to maintain their long lives by way of powerful magic.""* ‚Äì Hyrule Encyclopedia, pg. 45

And I know we haven‚Äôt been given much information on Gerudo lifespans before, but Creating a Champion does note that the Gerudo mature a bit more quickly than Hylians:

&gt;*‚ÄúShe \[Riju\] is about twelve years old, but because the Gerudo grow up faster than Hylians, she has a more mature air to her.‚Äù* ‚Äì Creating a Champion, pg. 137

While it‚Äôs unlikely that Twinrova could learn everything they need to know about how to find the Triforce by interrogating one person, they could easily interrogate multiple people for tiny morsels of information. And after 400 years of doing this, they‚Äôd have all the information they need. However, it‚Äôs worth asking why they wouldn‚Äôt just use this information for themselves. Why would they give that information to some random Gerudo king? Hyrule Historia tells us that Twinrova has been pulling the strings of the Gerudo for quite some time, but what does that mean when you throw their relationship with Ganondorf into the mix? Well, look at it from this perspective:

I said before that I believe the witches are the reason the Gerudo were at odds with Hyrule for a long time. I think they did this by manipulating previous Gerudo leaders into pulling away from alliances with the Royal Family and other races, and they probably encouraged Gerudo females to mate only with the sole Gerudo males as a way of further isolating their people. Then, when Ganondorf was born, they took it upon themselves (perhaps through force) to raise him and groom him into hating Hyrule. They fed him stories about how the Gerudo were tossed aside by Hylian society and how it wasn‚Äôt fair that the Gerudo were forced to live in harsh conditions while Hylians got live in beautiful green fields. They taught him how to use magic, encouraged him to favor brutality and cruelty over chivalry, and gave him an army of brainwashed followers. Finally, they told him everything he needed to know on how to enter the Sacred Realm and take the Triforce for himself.

So, back to some of my earlier questions: Why isolate the Gerudo from Hyrule? Why groom Ganondorf into hating Hyrule? Why brainwash people into following him? Why do all of this? Well, maybe Rauru and a Gossip Stone can help us:

&gt;*""They say that Gerudos worship Ganondorf almost like a* ***god***."" ‚Äì Gossip Stone (Ocarina of Time)  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúAncient Creators of Hyrule! Now, open the sealed door and send the* ***Evil Incarnation of Darkness*** *into the void of the Evil Realm!!‚Äù* ‚Äì Rauru (Ocarina of Time)

Rauru apparently had enough sense to understand that Ganondorf was an incarnation of darkness itself, and some of the Gerudo revered Ganondorf as a god. Therefore, I would go as far as to say that Twinrova had been pulling the strings of the Gerudo in an attempt to revive‚Ä¶ Demise.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the witches not only knew about the ancient Demon King, but idolized him, and they sought to bring about his reincarnation, or at least the reincarnation of his never-ending hatred and Malice. Through magic and manipulation, they were able pull it off by fostering an environment where a Gerudo king would hold immense hatred over Hyrule and desire the power to conquer it. Their reward for empowering Demise‚Äôs reincarnation would be more power, more longevity, and the satisfaction of being able to worship their ‚Äúgod‚Äù in the flesh.

As it happens, dabbling in resurrection isn‚Äôt unheard of for Twinrova. After Ganon‚Äôs defeat in ALttP, the witches attempted his resurrection in the Oracles by initiating the ‚ÄúDark Rites‚Äù:

&gt;*3„Å§„ÅÆÁÇé„Åå„ÄÄ„Åù„Çç„ÅÑ „ÄåËÅñ„Å™„Çã„Ç§„Ç±„Éã„Ç®„Äç„Çí„Åï„Åï„Åí„Åü„Å®„Åç Èóá„Çí„Åï„Åæ„Çà„ÅÜÂ§ßÈ≠îÁéã„Åå „Åì„ÅÆ„ÅÇ„Åã„Çä„ÇíÁõÆ„Åñ„Åó„ÄÄ„Çà„Åø„Åå„Åà„ÇãÔºÅ „Ç¶„Éí„É£„Éí„É£„Éí„É£„Éí„É£ÔºÅ*

&gt;  
&gt;*Our sacrifice will revive the Evil King and guide him to the light of the three flames! Oh ho ho ho!* ‚Äì Twinrova, Oracle of Ages/Seasons

&gt;  
&gt;*Once the ‚ÄúFlame of Ruin‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlame of Despair‚Äù are lit and we lift up the ‚ÄúHoly Sacrifice‚Äù, this dark ceremony handed down by us Gerudo will be complete. The Daimaou will be revived!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*When the Flames of Destruction and Despair are lit, we will offer up our sacrifice, and the dark rites of the Gerudo will be complete! Then the Evil King shall return!* ‚Äì Twinrova, Oracle of Ages/Seasons

Some interesting things to note here:

* Twinrova knew Zelda was ‚Äúholy‚Äù. If they knew she had some sort of holy blood or spirit, then knowing about Demise doesn‚Äôt seem so farfetched.
* Twinrova was aware that Ganon‚Äôs spirit was not obliterated, but merely ‚Äúwandering in the darkness‚Äù. This is consistent with what we learned in BotW about how demons can‚Äôt be killed by normal means. With enough power, their spirits can be pulled back into the living world to allow for their resurrection.

It would seem that Twinrova would do anything in their power to throw the Light World into darkness, even going so far as to sacrifice their own bodies for Ganon‚Äôs resurrection. But there‚Äôs still the question of how they acquired this power in the first place. Their brand of magic in particular is much darker than that of other witches in the series, so let‚Äôs try to connect it with other dark elements that can be found in association with the Gerudo.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, there‚Äôs the Trident, a device filled with dark magic that can turn one into a demon if they genuinely desire conquest and destruction:

&gt;*„Çª„Ç´„Ç§„ÄÄ„Ç¨„ÄÄ„Éõ„Ç∑„Ç§„ÄÄ„Ç´ „ÉÅ„Ç´„É©„ÄÄ„Ç¨„ÄÄ„Éõ„Ç∑„Ç§„ÄÄ„Ç´ „Çø„Ç§„ÇØ„ÉÑ„ÄÄ„Éä„ÄÄ„Éò„Ç§„ÉØ„ÄÄ„ÉÄ„Éà „ÇΩ„Éé„ÄÄ„Çø„Éû„Ç∑„Ç§„ÄÄ„Ç¨ „Ç´„ÉØ„ÇØ„ÄÄ„Éä„É©„Éê „Éè„Ç´„Ç§„ÄÄ„Éà„ÄÄ„Çª„Ç§„Éï„ÇØ„ÄÄ„É≤„Éà „ÇΩ„Éé„ÄÄ„Çø„Éû„Ç∑„Ç§„ÄÄ„Ç¨ „Çµ„Ç±„Éñ„ÄÄ„Éä„É©„Éê „Ç™„Éû„Ç®„ÄÄ„Éã„ÄÄ„Çµ„Ç∫„Ç±„ÄÄ„É®„Ç¶ „Çª„Ç´„Ç§„ÄÄ„É≤„ÄÄ„Éõ„É≠„Éú„Çπ „É§„Éü„ÄÄ„Éé„ÄÄ„ÉÅ„Ç´„É© „É®„ÇØ„Éú„Ç¶„ÄÄ„Éã„ÄÄ„Ç™„Éú„É¨ „Çπ„Éô„ÉÜ„ÄÄ„É≤„ÄÄ„Éõ„Ç∑„Ç¨„É¨  „Ç¢„É≥„Ç≥„ÇØ„ÄÄ„Ç´„É©„ÄÄ„Ç¶„Éü„Ç™„Éà„Çµ„É¨„Ç∑ „Éû„ÄÄ„Éé„ÄÄ„Ç∏„É£„Ç≠„ÄÄ„Éà„É©„Ç§„Éá„É≥„Éà „Ç™„Éû„Ç®„ÄÄ„Éè „É§„Éü„ÄÄ„Éé„ÄÄ„Ç™„Ç¶*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Do you desire the world? Do you desire power? If you are bored with peace and your soul thirsts... If your soul cries out for destruction and conquest... We grant you the dark power to destroy the world. Drown in desire and desire everything. Born from darkness, the evil tool of demons, the trident. You are the King of Darkness.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Seek...you...the world? Seek you...power? Does your...soul...despise peace and...thirst for... more? Does your soul...cry... for...destruction and... conquest? We...grant you...power to...ruin...the world. The power of...darkness. Drown in desire and desire everything. Evil...spirit of magic trident. You are...the...King of Darkness.* ‚Äì Inscription (Four Swords Adventures)

Thus far, we don‚Äôt have much to work with in regards to the Trident. What I can tell you is that, much like in OoT, the Gerudo are adamantly opposed to its use for evil purposes. Although the Pyramid it rests in is sacred to the Gerudo, it appears they attempted to hide away the Trident in the hopes that no one would use its power:

&gt;*‚ÄúThe Desert Temple was built to keep people away from the pyramid. None who enter the pyramid or the temple have ever returned. They are tombs. Yet the man has gone there by himself. All for the sake of his own mad desire!‚Äù* ‚Äì A Zuna (Four Swords Adventures)  
&gt;  
&gt;*""The pyramid is sacred to our people. To have a criminal such as him enter... His presence stains its holy ground.""* ‚Äî A Gerudo (Four Swords Adventures)

Unfortunately, even the history of the Pyramid is quite vague. The only thing FSA tells us is that the ancestors of the Zuna built it:

&gt;*""Oh, visitors to this village are truly rare, you know? We of the Zuna tribe live in this village. We may not look it now, but we are descended from the wise pyramid builders!""* ‚Äì A Zuna (Four Swords Adventures)

But the Zuna don‚Äôt seem particularly dark or evil either, so if they didn‚Äôt create the Trident, and the Gerudo want nothing to do with it, then who did? Once again, I have to make a connection to Twinrova, particularly because of these two parts of the Trident inscription:

&gt;‚Äú***We*** *grant you the dark power to destroy the world.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúYou are the* ***King of Darkness***.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt necessarily think Twinrova had the power to create the Trident, but I do think they were able to summon it or receive it somehow, and then they kept it in the Pyramid as a backup in case their groomed Gerudo king was unable to acquire the Triforce. Given what happened to Ganondorf I in the Child Timeline, it makes sense that, if Twinrova were still alive, they‚Äôd groom Ganondorf II into using the Trident rather than the Triforce to conquer and destroy Hyrule.

&amp;#x200B;

But that still doesn‚Äôt answer where the Trident came from or where Twinrova‚Äôs magic comes from, so let‚Äôs try to examine other dark elements that can be found in association with the Gerudo. One obvious place we can look is the base of operations for Twinrova, Ganondorf, and the brainwashed Nabooru: the Spirit Temple. While clearly of Gerudo origin, the temple is only used by the aforementioned individuals for evil purposes. Coincidentally, or not, the temple features ominous statues of what many have named the Goddess of the Sand, and even Navi was quick to point out that something wasn‚Äôt right about this ‚Äúgoddess‚Äù:

&gt;*""The Desert Colossus's face...it sure looks evil!""* ‚Äì Navi (Ocarina of Time)

Aah, have we found our smoking gun? Perhaps Navi is being a bit judgmental, but the Goddess of the Sand is actually a sensible culprit for the dark magic found in association with the Gerudo. For one thing, Ocarina of Time 3D made a point to emphasize some [greenish-yellow face paint](https://imgur.com/uBwUIrd) on the Desert Colossus. In many real-world cultures, similar face paintings have been used in rituals to symbolize magical or spiritual powers. In many cases they‚Äôre also meant to symbolize power and readiness for war. And, to Navi‚Äôs credit, that face does look kinda evil. Also to Navi's credit, the name for the Desert Colossus in Japanese is Â∑®Â§ßÈÇ™Á•ûÂÉè¬†(Kyodai Jashin Zou) Giant Evil God Statue (thanks to /u/Mido128 for that one).

Another thing to note is the obvious snake wrapped around her body. In western cultures snakes are associated with evil and sin, but in general snakes are often used to symbolize fertility, renewal of life, and strength. This creates a few interesting connections when we consider that the Gerudo have a unique birthing cycle, are associated with the continually reviving Demise, and have access to powerful dark magic. It‚Äôs also interesting that [Gerudo text](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/3/3f/GerudoAlphabet.jpg?version=af45ece1e7db79aed82c0644901a1f08) is very snake-like, which may imply that their origins tie into the Goddess of the Sand somehow.

Let me also point out that the Goddess of the Sand in OoT is shown with a [big red jewel on her chest](https://imgur.com/57hOSqv). Gerudo leaders often boast similar large jewels, which could symbolize power and status, but I also believe these jewels are meant to signify magical prowess. It was shown in BotW that the Gerudo are particularly skilled in crafting magical jewelry, so the rather prominent jewel on the Goddess of the Sands‚Äô chest could be a representation of exceptional magical ability. Although TP doesn‚Äôt depict the Goddess of the Sand with this jewel, it does depict her with [open hands that are lit with fire](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/wvw69kchibq9qqt9vu_orig.jpg). In each statue we see of her, she‚Äôs in a calm and meditative pose, further implying that she has exceptional control over magic.

Speaking of Twilight Princess, although I‚Äôve established the Gerudo as kindhearted and noble people, Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds is clearly meant to evoke a darker side to their culture. I don‚Äôt say that because of the ‚Äúprison‚Äù or execution aspect to Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds, but because of the presence of [ominous-looking ritualistic text](https://imgur.com/3mBVz4F), possible depictions of [Ganon and Link](https://imgur.com/qXLloDo) (or maybe Ganondorf transforming into Ganon), possible depictions of [Ganon or another demon with the Trident](https://imgur.com/9r1WvYz), and the general evil vibe coming from the [Goddess of the Sands statues](https://imgur.com/Qd6Gwg6). In fact, take a closer look at that last image, specifically to the left and right of the statue. There appear to be drawings of a [fiery entity holding a staff](https://imgur.com/dXRCJQd), and given the feminine and rather snake-like appearance, I‚Äôd bet this drawing is supposed to be an interpretation of the Goddess of the Sands.

Given all this context, is it possible she‚Äôs not a goddess at all? Early Gerudo architecture doesn‚Äôt give off a ‚Äúwe worship a benevolent goddess‚Äù feeling ‚Äì if anything, the darker aesthetic of the Spirit Temple and Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds make her seem more like a demon than a patron deity or goddess. So, this is where I tie things back to my earlier questions on how Twinrova acquired magic in the first place, and why Gerudo physiology is the way it is.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that ancestors of the Gerudo, possibly including Twinrova, were followers of Demise. Due to their association with darkness, they eventually came into contact with a demon who offered them the magical powers they needed to accomplish their goals, but at a price. Similar to how the Horned Statue demon in Hateno Village will trade health for stamina, or vice versa, the demon who bargained with the Gerudo gave them the powers they wanted, but cursed them to bear only females. This demon may have been the one who granted them the Trident, and perhaps its power was so great that none of the Gerudo were capable of using it until Ganondorf II came along. As for how one male was born every 100 years, I think they were able to make this happen through magical means, possibly by making periodic sacrifices. This would explain why the Gerudo are no longer capable of giving birth to males in BotW, because they clearly don‚Äôt dabble in that sort of magic anymore. But back when the males existed, the Gerudo ancestors (and/or Twinrova) ensured that those males were made king in an effort to foster the next incarnation of Demise. And as for where the rest of the magic-using Gerudo went, I have a feeling the majority of them were [banished](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda11/Walkthrough/HD20/024.jpg) at a certain point in time, leaving Twinrova to hide in the Spirit Temple and continue plotting from afar. The Gerudo that were left in Hyrule were the few that disagreed with Twinrova‚Äôs ways and opted for a life separated from their dark magic. That‚Äôs not to say the Gerudo have no magic at all, because the Gerudo royal family in BotW is capable of harnessing the power of electricity. But at the very least, they don‚Äôt touch dark magic anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¶Okay, I know that was hideously long, but I have one last thing to say. OoT3D made a point of [removing the sword from the Goddess of the Sands](https://imgur.com/jBkbxSg). When I found that out recently, it reminded me of how the 8th Heroine in BotW is missing her sword. So of course I started to wonder if there was a connection, and I think there may be. In reference to the Yiga hideout:

&gt;*‚ÄúThe area is home to unique Gerudo ruins and ancient shrines. It is common to see the preserved remnants of the ancient Gerudo.‚Äù* ‚Äì Creating a Champion, pg. 315

So, the Yiga hideout was inhabited by ancient Gerudo, and curiously there are 8 Heroine statues here, not 7. This implies that at some point in the Gerudo‚Äôs early history, they worshipped a total of 8 Heroines, but later the 8th Heroine was erased from their pantheon possibly because she represented something the Gerudo don‚Äôt want to associate with anymore. When looking at the Heroines in broader context with the Gerudo, I believe the 8th Heroine represents the use of dark magic. The other 7 hold a massive sword, which in my opinion is symbolic of natural physical and mental strength. The location of the 8th Heroine‚Äôs sword almost makes it seem like the statue itself tossed it aside, which may be representational of the early Gerudo who chose to favor dark magic. In this context, it‚Äôs fitting that the Yiga chose the ancient Gerudo ruin as their base, but perhaps it‚Äôs no coincidence:

&gt;*‚ÄúThere's a legend about seven heroines in the Gerudo region, but it turns out that an eighth heroine existed, and* ***she is worshiped to this day by her faithful in the Gerudo Highlands***. Show a picture of the eighth statue's torso to Bozai to get the sand boots. You've heard that there's someone well acquainted with the seven heroines' legend in Gerudo Town.‚Äù ‚Äì Quest Description (Breath of the Wild)

We don't see any Gerudo living in the highlands, but we do see the Yiga living there. The Yiga also seek the revival of Ganon, exactly the same as Twinrova did. Knowing this, is it possible the 8th Heroine is the Goddess of the Sand? Perhaps time will tell‚Ä¶",80,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c4vbe7,I hope Master Mode will be handled differently this time.,"(This is all based on the assumption that BotW2 will be broadly similar to BotW1 of course)

&amp;#x200B;

BoTW has tons of mechanics that are flat-out OP, ""broken"" or exploitable, basically making the game really easy. Think of stuff like eating mid-fight, Mipha's Grace, Gale'n'Glide, etc. I think this was a deliberate choice on Nintendo's part, simply because they want to reach a very broad audience. This means making some concessions in terms of difficulty, even if it can make everything trivial to a more experienced player. I can't be sure if it was 100% the right call, but I think it's a sensible reason.

These overpowered mechanics are why the Great Plateau is such an amazing intro: It's astoundingly difficult by 3D Zelda standards, and it has this very survival-ish feeling to it because most of these abilities aren't there yet. The moment you get the Paraglider, some of this magic is lost due to the incredible mobility buff, plus the fact that large drops lose their danger. Even if you don't cover large distances with it and only use it to soften a landing, it's still having a massive effect on your gameplay.

So over all, if you're an experienced player, getting the most fun out of BotW probably involves deactivating/not using lots of abilities and having some sort of ruleset to play by to increase the challenge. At least that's what is was like to me.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where Master Mode really should've come into play IMO. It should've been all about reducing Link's capabilities. By nerfing or restricting some aspects, other ones come to the forefront. Remove the ability to eat at any time. Do something about how absolutely broken Flurry Rush is^((tbh BotW2 needs a different system in general)), nerf or even restrict gliding. Maybe even enhance the survival mechanics by making hot/cold weather harder to deal with, and so on and so forth.

Importantly, I think that these difficulty changes would need to be categorised and optional; an exploration-oriented player might enjoy more deliberate terrain traversal, while a more action-oriented player would only want more difficult combat without slowing the rest of the game down. In addition, parts of the game would need changes to make sure certain stuff wouldn't become totally impossible, for example if there's a glider nerf involved.

So anyway, instead Master Mode just kinda ramps up enemy difficulty by making everything one colour tougher, and adding regen. In my experience this actually failed to really increase the challenge; not only are the broken mechanics still there (if you want to use them), but the floating platforms and regular enemies are full of powerful weapons to loot, offsetting the enemy buffs. Because of this I think the difficulty increase (outside of stuff like TotS) is actually a bit questionable. Therefore, I think it isn't really the right way to make a ""hard mode"" for this sort of game.

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary, I'm hoping for a mechanics-based ""Master Mode"" instead of a numbers-based one.",14,public,,0

So this video shows a bunch of the scrapped ideas, including concept art, for BotW ‚Äî like 6 more divine beasts, UFOs, the hookshot and beetle, and most importantly, the Minish village. I think the Minish village has a very good chance of being used in the sequel for two reasons. First, the game‚Äôs director (who‚Äôs quoted in the video) sounded like he REALLY wanted the Minish in BotW1, and that he was really sad when they didn‚Äôt get used. And secondly, since it looks like the sequel will be taking place in Hyrule again, shrinking down would be a good way for Nintendo to reuse the same game world while still giving us new content and areas to explore. Here‚Äôs a link to that video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UxHbpi83u0k

Perhaps with expanded towns, new dungeons added, underground sections, etc. Was this ever alluded to or stated by anyone from Nintendo? 

Obviously the events shown in the trailer take place in the same Hyrule but that could be just an opening section of the game. I think that a huge part of the appeal of BotW was exploring a brand new, vast map of Hyrule. My assumption would be that we‚Äôre getting an entirely new map to explore. Whether that takes the form of a ‚ÄúDark World‚Äù or means we are transported somewhere new, I have no idea.

truezelda,t3_c3njer,Is Ganondorf‚Äôs body REALLY under Hyrule Castle? And how does BOTW 2 begin?,"To answer the question about Ganondorf‚Äôs body blunty, I believe it‚Äôs under the castle, but a [video](https://youtu.be/2DKsjGIispE) by youtuber Hyrule Gamer, has me thinking about why I believe that and what it means for the beginning of the game. Hyrule Gamer suggests that the cave/underground structure seen in the trailer may be somewhere far from the castle like in the Hebra region which means Ganondorf is not under the castle and that the scene in which the castle rises upward could be essentially a red herring. 

While I agree the entrance to the cave/underground that Link and Zelda explore could be anywhere, I believe the cave system could still lead back to underneath the castle where Ganondorf‚Äôs body rests. Here is some possible evidence and of course spoilers:

The king says that Calamity Ganon appeared from deep below Hyrule Castle. In the game we see that after Ganon appears, he spreads malice outward from there. If Ganondorf were somewhere else, would it not be efficient to leak malice from the place where he is?
Speaking of the king, we know his tomb is on the Great Plateau and until you beat the game, his spirit is confined there. Same goes for the Champions who cannot leave their divine beasts until Ganon is defeated. This may be the case for Calamity Ganon. He cannot leave the castle until freed because his body is there. Yes, Zelda does use her sealing power to contain Ganon; however, it may only be to keep him from swarming the castle and spreading more malice than it is to keep him from leaving. This would make sense for why Calamity Ganon is still at the castle when Zelda arrives. 

Maybe the malice found in different areas of the game have eyes so Calamity Ganon can see any threats such as Link he wouldn‚Äôt be able to see from the castle. Malice is a physical manifestation of hatred free to spread, while the Calamity is a conscience limited to the castle. Which makes sense as malice is used as a way for Ganon to make a new body outside the castle as shown in the last phase of the final battle.

Again, this is not to say that the entrance is underneath the castle as we see Link and Zelda venturing on a pack animal which would make sense if the cave system was quite large. What I believe may happen at the beginning of the game is Link and Zelda find out about the cave/dungeon and go exploring. The shots we see in the trailer are parts of various cutscenes as the player ventures deeper into the cave leading back to Hyrule Castle. Ganondorf is somehow released from his seal and the castle lifts off the ground as a reaction. Although I admit that scene could be purposefully misleading.

Looking at other Nintendo series such as Metroid or Xenoblade, I find the T rating to be more justified, as those series have multiple on-screen deaths of good guys, cursing or a general sense of dread at a much higher level than TP.

Heck, Dark Souls II and Final Fantasy XIV got away with the T rating despite the grimdark atmosphere of Dark Souls II and the prostitution jokes in XIV.

Similarly, in terms of violence, only Zant‚Äôs neck snaps sticks out, and it still doesn‚Äôt come at the levels of stabbing Ganondorf‚Äôs head in WW. The overall darkest thing is TP (Shadow beasts killing most of Kakariko) happens completely offscreen, and that got recently eclipsed by the Great Calamity, which also happened offscreen, but with far more casualties. In terms of NPCs reacting to antagonists, MM absolutely destroys TP, as everyone in Clock Town knows their deaths are coming, while nobody in Hyrule Castle Town seems to be aware that Ganondorf is back and Zelda is a lifeless body.

Am I missing something or could this be a story hook for the sequel? Right now I am inclined to subscribe to the theory that we didn't really defeat Ganon and what we fought was Shiekah tech infused with Malice until the tech portion was destroyed and formed the final malice version. 

The Master Sword is optional and not needed to win, unlike all other games. It is possible that we were fighting a puppet and the prophecy was referring to something buried underneath the divine beasts and that's why Link and Zelda are searching underground.

truezelda,t3_c35i5r,Zelda vs. Krystal,"The Zelda series has several examples of strong female characters.  Great examples include Medli from WW, Faron from SS, Impa from the same game, and Midna from TP.  I don't believe Zelda is one of them.

Earlier today I was having a debate in a Reddit comment section over whether Zelda can ever be described as a strong female character throughout the entire series.  I think classic examples like &gt;!Shiek!&lt; are bad because &gt;!Shiek!&lt; doesn't actually do anything in OoT and is clearly dumber than a tomato.  &gt;!Tetra!&lt; is also a bad example because while clearly she's a badass with a history outside the game, in the actual game she doesn't do anything until she is revealed to be Zelda and then she *really* doesn't do anything.  Another common example is ST Zelda, and I have actually heard great things about her.  ST is the only Legend of Zelda game I have not played, so I will trust the community on that.  We'll call her the exception to the rule.

Please keep in mind, I actually really like SS Zelda and BotW Zelda--I just would not call them ""strong female characters.""  They are largely just damsels in distress, but well-written ones this time around.

Anyway, later in the day I was watching a video about Star Fox Adventures, and it hit me that Krystal is more active and more hands-on than any Zelda (setting aside ST Zelda).  She has a whole thing in the beginning where she's taking charge, embarking on her own to save a whole planet, etc.  She is much more actively involved in the plot of SFA than Zelda has ever been.

The reason this struck me is that, while Krystal is a stronger character than Zelda's incarnations, I don't think anybody here would agree that Krystal is a strong female character.  I certainly would not consider her as one.  But if she is not a strong female character, then Zelda *definitely* is not.

I'm not really looking to have my mind changed on that.  It struck me so hard though, I really wanted to see what this community thought about Zelda in comparison to Krystal.  I figured this was better than just waiting and picking a fight or something like that.  I'm just curious what your thoughts are on the following question, regardless of if I agree or not:

- Can Princess Zelda (in a general sense, rather than a specific incarnation) be considered to be a strong character if Krystal is a weak character?

truezelda,t3_c2s6bf,[Cadence of Hyrule] Timeline Placement Theory,"Just finished my first playthrough of the game, and some interesting thoughts had come across my mind. In my opinion, the points listed below seem to point CoH towards a certain timeline:

1. What if this game is actually set during the 'Sheikah Advance Civilization Era' \[""reunification of triforce"" after AoL *or* ""Peace and Prosperity"" after FSA\], but before the first attack from Calamity Ganon? This can be seen from all the Blue-Eyed Sheikah Technology throughout this game, but the lack of Divine Beasts. (AT is being excluded from this theory as CoH is actually set in old-Hyrule)

To some extent, in support of BotW DT theory, I feel like the presence of Goron in this game might also indicates that Goron has finally moved back from Holodrum/Labrynna as Ganon is no longer a threat?

The only arguments I can think of that go against my theory are:

1. Teen Ganondorf can be seen playing his organ in this game, and was corrupted by Golden Lute before transforming into Ganon, instead of being resurrected directly in Ganon form as we usually seen in DT. This, however, is not an issue for CT. (Might also mean that yellow stripe hat/brown undershirt doesn't actually imply anything?)
2. Obviously, this game is not canon

In short, I theorized CoH to fall under DT/CT, set sometime after AoL/FSA, but before BotW.

truezelda,t3_c2nk13,"Yet another post of predictions for BoTW2. I had some neat theories based on the teaser trailer that I'm not sure have been said yet. If they have, I apologize.","**Prediction 1: The Gerudo will be the Sheikah of this game:**

We all know that the Sheikah got a massive boost in importance in Breath of the Wild. Previously depicted as the hidden figures of Hyrule, operating out of the shadows and as a result not physically appearing very often, Breath of the Wild opted to make them perhaps the most important race to this new world. The Sheikah Slate, Sheikah Towers, Sheikah Shrines, and tons of enemies made of Sheikah Technology were just everywhere, and they even got three distinct variations with the old monks, modern people living in Kakariko village, and traitorous Yiga Clan. 

But it is also worth noting that the Gerudo got second place in terms of importance. Sure, their marks on the land were not nearly as prevalent as the Sheikah, but everything from their culture, unique quirks, and place in Hyrule's ecosystem got a massive boost. We as players have dealt with Gorons, Zora, and Koroks/Kokiri for awhile, so Breath of the Wild didn't add anything too new to them. And Rito, while fairly new, were noticeably not given much focus, a pretty common complaint against the game, actually. Meanwhile the Gerudo were fleshed out immensely, as we got to explore our first Gerudo town that wasn't simply a fortress of some kind. We got to befriend them, and learn of their history. 

The teaser for Breath of the Wild 2 showcases a ton of Gerudo stuff as well. Their symbols are everywhere, including painted on the walls of (presumably) Hyrule castle's underbelly, suggesting a closer connection to the royal family than we once thought, and the trailer focuses primarily on a dead Gerudo (probably Ganondorf) being revived. Now, it's very easy to say that this was simply a small aspect of the game that they chose to focus on with this trailer and does not show the wide scope of the story as a whole. And that is true to some degree. However, Nintendo chose to show us this as our first glimpse of the game. Our first glimpse of the original Breath of the Wild focused on the more open setting and the Guardian enemies, two things that played the biggest part in Breath of the Wild as a whole. It's a bit odd to make this first glimpse into the game so focused on Gerudo symbolism if the actual game will just relegate them to background character status. I think their culture and technology will play a huge role in the game.

**Prediction 2: The story of the Champions is not done yet:**

It is widely believed that Breath of the Wild was the last we will see of the old Champions, what with the game ending showing their spirits moving on and basically setting up four new heroes to take their place should the Champion plot-line continue on. However, I have had good reason to believe, or maybe hope I guess, that the story isn't done for awhile now. Firstly, Nintendo knows how popular those characters were after that game. They even created a DLC to do a bit more with them in response to people complaining that they did not get nearly as much focus as they should have. The official book they released also goes into a ton of detail about the creation and designs of the Champions, and how much time was spent on fleshing them out and giving them backstory and character traits that we never actually got to see in the game. It would seem a bit odd to just abandon those characters completely, especially now that we know we are getting a direct sequel to their debut game, something that rarely happens in the Zelda series.

Now, as much as I want the Champions to be brought back to life somehow to be travel partners for Link and Zelda, I'm not going to sit here and suggest that the teaser somehow proves that this will happen, because it doesn't. I will however say that the teaser gave many glimpses at potential vehicles through which a potential resurrection or simply more story content starring them could happen. First is that the trailer clearly shows the revival of Ganondorf(?) as a focus. Does this mean necromancy is a big focus of the game? Maybe, maybe not. But it does mean that we have seen that it is possible in this world. Second are the prevalent teal lights throughout the trailer. You all may recognize their striking resemblance to the universal color for spirits in the last game, with all four Champions and the King being depicted as tinted this color with flames of the same color floating around them. Now this could just be random spirits and not their specific ones, but it is worth noting that if this is Ganondorf's spirit, its a bit inconsistent with the red malice that was shown to be his essence both in the last game and this teaser.

The last hint is probably the biggest one. As many have found by now, playing the trailer backwards reveals that at certain points throughout, the words ""help us"" can be heard whispered. Could this be the Champions? Maybe. You do have to wonder what dead characters would be calling out to Link and Zelda for help if not them or the king. The Champions were ""freed"" by Link after clearing their Divine Beasts in the last game, but many questions were still left unanswered. If the Champions were trapped in their Beasts and killed by Ganon, why didn't Link find their remains when he went aboard? I mean, that would be pretty morbid for a kids' game, but it is worth asking. If they died here, where did their bodies go? Could they still be held down there under the castle, trapped by either Ganon or whatever owns that strange hand? I guess we'll find out.

**Prediction 3: Hyrule will be a bit more populated in this game:**

Another thing many people want to see in a sequel is a more populated and civilized Hyrule. The desolate land was cool, but going through a natural world yet again would seem as if no progress was made by the end of the last game. Seeing easier trade between races, more cross-population in different towns, and even a rebuilt and bustling Hyrule Castle Town would do a nice job at showing the effect Link's actions had on the world, and make players feel more fulfilled as a result. After all, many were hoping for a post-game dealing with just this when the original game came to an end.

But believe it or not, I think this short trailer gives us a few bits of evidence to suggest that is exactly what we will get. First are some small things. Zelda has managed to have her hair cut, and she and Link are seen alongside a new mount loaded down with tons of supplies. All of this suggests the two had access to civilized means, such as a barber or supply shops and just generally are more well-prepared going into this than Link was in the last game, starting with just his underwear and a stick. The larger suggestion to me however is that I believe some time has passed. Like, a significant amount of time. 

It would be easy to suggest that Link and Zelda went to explore the crypts of Hyrule Castle almost immediately after the events of the first game. Maybe they stocked up and headed down. But notably, Zelda says at the end of Breath of the Wild exactly what they're going to do. She wants to go to Zora's Domain and find out why the Divine Beast has shut down. That's pretty far-removed from ""Let's go underground."" And if they did go under the castle so soon after Link defeated Ganon, it begs the question of why this would be one of the first thoughts. Why not contact the disparate races across the land? Why not reconstruct the castle itself? What would make them want to investigate these crypts so soon? 

Taking all these clues into account, it seems the underground trip is not as a close to the ending of the first game as many seem to think. Perhaps it's even tremor-related complaints of residents of a repopulated castle town that lead to the two investigating underneath. None of Zelda's outlined goals at the end of the last game talk about a trip such as the one we see in the trailer.

**Prediction 4: Underground and maybe underwater areas will be a big gameplay feature:**

As with my reasoning behind the Gerudo prediction, I think this first trailer showcased an underground area for a reason. What better way to expand and change the world of Breath of the Wild for a sequel without throwing away all the work done on it the last time than by adding new levels to the terrain? Death Mountain could be left structurally the same, but now have entrances to underground cave networks full of lava pools or even, surprisingly, cooler areas. An entire Deku civilization could exist underneath Korok Forest. Kakariko Village could have a massive crypt full of the spookier enemies of the series. The list goes on.

And I'm throwing in underwater areas as well, because why wouldn't they? This is yet another way to add new dimension to pre-existing areas, and its a mechanic that many fans wanted in the last game. The devs even said it was a mechanic they originally wanted to include. What if the pool under King Zora's throne contained ancient tomes detailing Zora history? Or what if there was even a hidden civilization of the more hostile river Zoras only accessed by swimming through an underwater tunnel?   
I'm giving all of these suggestions to showcase why the devs may have decided to make underground and underwater areas their only real change to the world set up in the previous game. It would allow so many new areas and mechanics and make the world feel fresh while still allowing a shorter development time and less work overall than building a whole new world from scratch. And I think the setting of the trailer is a large indication of that.

**Random and Small Predictions:**

1) Link's new glowing hand will be an important gameplay feature. Seems pretty obvious. Maybe it acts as the Sheikah Slate of this game?

2) Zelda will be playable. More of a leap since nothing has really been hinted at here, but fan demand as well as her shorter hair and presence in the trailer may suggest it.

3) Traditional dungeons will return. Now that all four Divine Beasts have been dealt with, and all Sheikah Shrines have been found, it seems right that there would be no other choice but to return to traditional dungeons. Maybe the underground area from the trailer is even one.

4) More emphasis on story. Story was the biggest complaint of people from the last game, so it seems right that Nintendo would go all in on it this time. It has also been compared to Majora's Mask by the developers themselves, a game which is arguably the most story-heavy game in the series, with long and intricate sidequests comprising the majority of the gameplay.",13,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c2tq0u,I didn't like BOTW,"I didn't like BOTW. The cooking system was broken, there was no challenge unless I was risking 1 hit KO's because I could pause and refill my health at any moment. I didn't need to collect heart containers or stamina increases anymore because I just horded food that gave me mask extra hearts and stamina.

I would have loved the collection of weapons and armor but it didn't feel like an interesting form of collection, plus everything was very disposable, (I understand why for balance reasons).

The Kokorok challenges and shrines were bad, it was the same thing over and over and over and over and over. It felt so Grindy.

The game world was so big yet it felt like the enemies had little variety, I wonder how many actually different enemy types BOTW had compared to other Zelda games, due to its scope it probably needs way more to not feel repetitive.

it gets applauded for its art style, and I don't dislike the art style, but I kind of preferred the art style of skyward sword. 

The game design reminded me a lot of spirit tracks in a lot of ways.

The game was very open in how it let you do anything in the order you want. I'm not a big fan of that. Also I feel like it has a lot of downsides, for example when I had to go to the Hateno ancient tech lab I ended up getting there by climbing the long way up to it and getting directly there. After I got there I went through the town from the lab to the entrance and it felt like I was playing the game backwards, the designers clearly planned on me entering the town from the entrance and seeing all the hints (like the gossping women) and characters (like the guy at the entrance) in a specific order as I made my way up, but I didn't.

None of the bosses felt memorable to me. There designs just seemed chaotic and too similar. Aside from the over world bosses, but once again it gets repetitive the third time.

EDIT: a minor point but did the game have cut content? When it was a wii u only title they showed the game with a more detailed and  beautiful interactive map but that was removed, and I recall them showing some version of the game made like the first Zelda, I thought that'd be in the game, maybe as a loading screen game or you could play it if you went to some arcade area or something.",3,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c2ofhw,Let's set the record straight here and now.,"The hysteria revolving around the trailer for BoTW's sequel still has the mass media in a joyous frenzy; people are ceaselessly sharing theories, suggestions for what they would like to experience in the game, etc and that's likely to continue its grip on the masses for weeks to come. That's fine and all, but of course when something gains this level of online recognition, you have a dedicated group that seems to relish the idea of spreading misinformation that ultimately leads to a widespread fallacy.

&amp;#x200B;

*Enter 4chan.*

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know, the trailer contains back-to-back speculative material that many people are trying to ascertain or get a better understanding of, and among them is the impression that the coalescent spiral that emanates from the mysterious hand suppressing Ganondorf's corpse, are characters from the Gerudo typography.  I, for one, am skeptical of this primarily because these formations lack definitive depth and rigidity to truly be discernible to fit the classification. To get an idea on how definite they would have to be in order to be discernible they would more-or-less have to be similar in depth like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Ezlo's Incantation](https://media.giphy.com/media/13BDk2gIB1VAnS/giphy.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

As seen in Ezlo's incantation that involved syllabary belonging to TWW styled Hylian, we can clearly distinguish the characters as they don't seamlessly sway away from their structure and maintains cohesion in clarity, contrary to what is seen here:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So there's my stance on that, but of course overzealous 4chan members thinks otherwise, and believes that these partially indecipherable characters spells out ""Seal Ganon"". There are numerous articles posted on different media outlets covering this, and is trending on twitter apparently:

&amp;#x200B;

So against my own judgement, I decided to entertain the topic and look into it even further by matching anything that I remotely think sufficiently enough resemble Gerudo typography. What conclusion did I arrive to? **They're only seeing what they want to see!** Here is my discovery:

Obviously it could be explained away by reincarnation (like in FSA) or some other method, but it feels strange that this would be the case. From a storytelling perspective, when the player sees a corpse, their first thought is ‚Äúhow did this death occur?‚Äù and not necessarily ‚Äúhow is this body even here on this timeline?‚Äù For the sake of fluidity, it makes sense to have this game on a timeline where the body still exists.",10,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c2j6jf,Castle rising and Sheikah technology,"We can't yet tell (due to the dust cloud) whether the castle is actually floating, or simply rising up on a giant pillar like the towers rose from the ground in BoTW.  Regardless, we know that the emergence of Calamity Ganon caused the 5 pillars surrounding the castle to activate, so it seems plausible that the castle's rising in the trailer could be due to some sort of similar ""trigger"" that is tethered to the Ganondorf corpse that awakens.

If that is the case, then the reason that all of the towers and shrines are gone (in the trailer) is likely *not* due to Sheikah technology losing its capabilities.  (The loss of Sheikah technology's operation could be postulated based upon Zelda noting that one of the Divine Beasts has stopped operating at the end of BoTW.)  It must be something else.  

So I think we have two possibilities: 

1. Sheikah technology is still operable (making the castle rise), in which case we don't know why the shrines and towers are gone.  This also means we could (conceivably) retain the Sheikah Slate in the sequel for Link's abilities.

2. Sheikah technology has failed for some reason, which fits nicely with the Divine Beast failing and the shrines and towers being gone.  But then we are still left without a world-consistent explanation (until the sequel tells us, of course) for the castle rising in the trailer.  And we would almost certainly be without the Sheikah Slate as the source for Link's abilities in the sequel.

truezelda,t3_c23u7t,[BoTW2] How would you feel if bottles made a return to the series?,"With all the things people are hoping to see make a return to the game I rarely see anyone mention bringing back collectable bottles. For me being able to carry dozens upon dozens of potions and elixirs made the cooking mechanic in BoTW too OP. Especially when you could pause the game and drink potentially a dozen or more healing potions at any time mid-fight, even in the early stages of the game.

I loved collecting bottles in previous games and it was always an exciting surprise and significant ‚Äúpower up‚Äù whenever you obtained one. I think this could make a great reward for certain side quests and finding a hidden bottle, maybe in some ruins or on a mountaintop, while exploring Hyrule would be very uplifting.

I think this could be a good way to make the cooking mechanic less OP, without abandoning it altogether, and would add some more strategy to what you bring with you into battle as you can only hold as many elixirs, potions, or fairies as you have bottles. I was thinking you could get your first bottle at the end of this games version of the Great Plateau tutorial and maybe the mentor would then drop a hint where you could start searching for a second bottle, if you so choose. That way you start the game with at least one bottle and could find a second one relatively quickly. Also since it is such a massive world maybe they would increase the number of bottles to around 10-12, instead of the usual 5-6, so you have a good chance of getting at least a few in the earlier stages of the game.

What do you think? Would you like to have collectable bottles again or would it negate the cooking mechanic too much?

I avoided googling anything about the game until after my second divine beast, and when I found out that the only other dungeon was Hyrule castle, I was super disappointed. At the time I had figured there was something about these dragons and the springs that would lead to 3 more dungeons.

Now that I‚Äôm replaying it, the flashbacks mention the 3 springs a lot, and the dragons are extremely unique, they even have their own musical number.

truezelda,t3_c20a67,[BotW] Just found another point that goes against Child Placement,"Before I start the discussion, just wanted to say that I really hope BotW get placed after TP. After all, TP is my favorite Zelda game. However, I much prefer analyzing information rationally. So without further ado, let‚Äôs get started :)

According to ‚ÄòCreating a Champion‚Äô page 401,
&gt;It is written that Calamity Ganon once adopted the form of a Gerudo and, since he was the rare male born to the Gerudo, was made king. But that wasn't enough for the man known as Ganondorf.

The next paragraph then continued with 
&gt;According to Gerudo records there has not been another male Gerudo leader since the king who became the Calamity.

In summary, at least based on my understanding, first paragraph mentions two key points.
1. The event which occurred in OoT
2. Calamity Ganon originated from Ganondorf of OoT

The second paragraph then mentions that
1. There has only been one Gerudo-Ganondorf since OoT (i.e. there‚Äôs still malice and hatred of Demise reincarnated, but not in the form of Gerudo)

Therefore, this implies that, regardless of which timeline BotW takes place in, there‚Äôs only one Gerudo-Ganondorf in this timeline. Child timeline having two Ganondorf means that it does not fit into the description mentioned above (should also rule out the ‚ÄòGanondorf25‚Äô theory in one of the Zeldauniverse ‚Äòs forum post üòÇ). 

Of course, this can simply means that FSA‚Äôs Gerudo-Ganondorf is somehow not written down in Gerudo‚Äôs record, or the events occurred in FSA are not canon (even though I find both these arguments relatively weak). In addition, I‚Äôm also aware that Miyamoto-San / Aonuma-San did not have direct influence on the making of this book. 

But otherwise, I find this argument quite solid, not to rule BotW into DT, but out of CT.

truezelda,t3_c28kfd,The Guardians in the Zonai locations,"I always wondered why there were large numbers of Guardians in the Forgotten Temple, as well as underground on Lomei Labyrinth Island. These are both Zonai ruins, right? I think this might be relevant, especially considering that from the trailer for BOTW 2, Ganondorf appears to be sealed in a Zonai temple. However, most other Zonai locations do not have any Guardians at all. All the Guardians, except the Skywatchers, in the Zonai locations have that look where they seem to be covered in moss and look at least a little decayed (even the Guardian Stalkers). With the exception of the Skywatchers, they are all inactive until Link enters the area.

So I'm guessing that thousands of years ago the Zonai were able to take possession of a number of Guardian units, and seeing the Forgotten Temple and the Lomei Labyrinth Island as being particularly important locations, for whatever reason, decided to position Guardian units there. However, over thousands of years they decayed from environmental conditions. Then, either, 100 years ago Calamity Ganon took them over, or Calamity Ganon senses Link in the area and then takes over the Guardian units in the area, activating them.

I wonder if the presence of these Guardians is a sign one of these locations may actually house Ganondorf himself. I don't know why Calamity Ganon would otherwise mobilize such large numbers of Guardians to these areas.

**Please Note**:  *This is a controversial topic which tends to rile people up and close minds, so please take a deep breath--perhaps a toke--and try to enjoy yourself.  Obviously, the timeline placement of BotW has not been conclusively indicated thus far by in-game evidence or developer statements, so with any attempt to analyze, I ask that we try to recognize the strength of established lore and* [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/86q6gf/what_constitutes_evidence_in_a_changing_and/) *first, before we build speculation upon it.*

*Also, I tend to speak very literally and emphasize the empirical interpretation of evidence, so please don't take this for arrogance or rudeness (I often forget how I sound).  I fully accept the possible DT placement as well, which is commonly upheld in this subreddit, but the AT gets dismissed all too unfairly.*

&amp;#x200B;

Most people who disagree with the plausibility of a BotW AT placement cite only a few points to disqualify it, despite evidence in favor, but the strength which they perceive in that disqualification comes from a certain lack of knowledge regarding the AT, I notice, especially surrounding the lore of WW, or else assumptions regarding its consequences.

So, to address that (and to keep this as brief as possible), I will just list a few of those common points and then juxtapose them below with established lore, precedents, and evidence:

1. 'Hyrule was completely flooded at the end of WW, and so it can't be the setting for BotW because it would have to dry out or be drained.'
2. 'Ganondorf was killed at the end of WW, and so Ganon couldn't possibly return in the AT or become Calamity Ganon.'
3. 'The Master Sword was left in Ganondorf's forehead, so it's stuck forever at the bottom of the ocean.'
4. 'The Triforce was used at the end of WW and it flew away.  It has yet to be seen again in the AT, so it will never again appear in the AT.'
5. 'All of the Zora in the world lived in Zora's Domain during OoT, all of them transformed into the Rito after the flood, and no other Zora could remain alive after WW due to the Great Sea.'

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few bits of lore and evidence that many people are unaware of or miss all too commonly, which contradict the supposed disqualification of an AT BotW setting:

**One**:  The Deku Tree performs an *annual* ceremony wherein he sends out his seeds (via Korok) to sprout magic 'forest trees', which enlarge the islands and layer atop ancient Hyrule, even so much that they may eventually displace the seas and form the land anew (which we see exemplified in the [Forest Haven](https://www.google.com/search?q=forest+haven+wind+waker&amp;rlz=1C1GCEV_enUS854US854&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHzN2Qp_HiAhVmwlQKHYiPBzQQ_AUIESgC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=hJ7fNiYR30Kj-M:) and its offshoot which emerges nearby from underwater). Concerning these 'forest trees', the Deku Tree says,

&gt;Forests hold great power: they can change one tiny island into a much larger island. Soon, a day will come when all the islands are one, connected by earth and grove. And the people who live on that great island will be able to join hands and, together, create a better world. Such is my dream.

Uniform tree species (in Zelda of real life) grow their canopy to relatively uniform heights in a given setting, grounded upon earth, so it's valid to expect that the contours of ancient Hyrule would remain somewhat preserved on this new surface, rooted on the seafloor. Additionally, the Deku Tree possesses a strong nostalgia for the bygone era that was destroyed by the flood, which could no doubt influence his design, I'd argue, along with the various gods (as well as Death Mountain/ Dragon Roost Island).

Given the untold eons in the backstory of BotW, such an endeavor could have long ago been completed and aged into the land which we see (among other things), even explaining 'the ancient sea' which left rock salt as well as the lineages of the Deku Tree, the Koroks, and the Rito.

**Two**:  Obviously some assumptions about Ganon(dorf) could be upturned in BotW2, but the powers and methods which revive Ganon(dorf) are not well established.  Yet, according to the timeline (even the one which we all originally based the DT upon), he has demonstrated an ability to reincarnate after his death in TP and even revive after being destroyed (exploding into thin air) numerous times in the DT, so the assumptions surrounding Ganon(dorf)'s presumed deletion in the AT remain untenable (and more often than not, based on personal feelings regarding the ending of WW or the AT).

Also, nowhere in King Daphnes' Triforce wish is it defined that Ganondorf is gone forever (unlike Demise) and he certainly didn't 'drown with Hyrule' (he was impaled), so the future of Hylians, which was lent by the Triforce wish, may indeed one day encounter him again.

**Three**:  As far as we know, Jabun could yank that thing out of Ganondorf's forehead, or else recover it from the top of his tower beneath the ocean.  A joke, I know, but true.  The disappearance and reappearance of the Master Sword is a common feature of Zelda history, leaving no conclusive reason to doubt its discovery in the future.  As long as it remains anywhere in the world, it could surely could be found again, as it has been again and again.

**Four**:  Like the Master Sword, the elusiveness of the Triforce is a staple of the series, even featuring legends within legends about people seeking it or forgetting it (even as it has lost prominence in BotW).  We have been given no evidence that it is eternally lost after WW, and its deletion would make the fabric of the world unravel, as we see in ALBW.

**Five**:  As with the Gerudo in the DT, an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  The Zora featured in BotW are distinctly diverse in their phenotypes from previous examples--setting them apart from their physiology in any previous game, regardless of the timeline setting.  Although their history references things which are only known to have happened in the AT or DT, their previous dwelling (before arriving to build their new domain, prior to BotW) remains shrouded in mystery.

Concerning the AT during WW, the only evidence for the Zora (other than the blood of the Rito and an ability to transform) are 'Ruto Crowns' that are found scattered in New Hyrule (as well as PH, but that setting is suspect), which are rumored to have been passed down among generations of Zora royalty. It's not proof of any sort, but it remains a possible indication of the history of New Hyrule--a vast continent which has not yet been fully explored in the series (and didn't flood).

truezelda,t3_c1s9xw,"SPECULATION: If evidence that BOTW is Downfall isn‚Äôt contradicted in BOTW2, Ganondorf is going to explain a lot.","This is something I‚Äôve been considering ever since BOTW2‚Äôs reveal at e3. I completely subscribe to the Downfall placement because of process of elimination and clear evidence, and, if BOTW2 continues to be touchy with its references, I don‚Äôt believe this will change anytime soon. That means that the Ganondorf body seen in this timeline is the first time we‚Äôve seen the man in the flesh during this timeline.

This could be a game-changer.

It‚Äôs hard for me to deny that the biggest question-mark on the events in the timeline are the threads between Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past - not because it hasn‚Äôt been elaborated on, but because it has never expressly been demonstrated in a game. The main details we can affirm from this point is that
1. Ganondorf became pig Ganon as we know him between the two games.
2. He was sealed in the Sacred Realm with the complete Triforce.
As of now, we have only heard of the context behind these status quo alterations from secondhand sources such as books. But now that BOTW2 is reviving Ganondorf, we may have a firsthand source of exactly what happened in the alternate ending of OoT.

Of course, I could be misreading the situation. Maybe Ganondorf will be just as vague with his history as BOTW was. Maybe he will reveal that we missed the clues and we‚Äôre not actually in Downfall. Maybe it‚Äôs a new Ganondorf entirely and we‚Äôll learn nothing of the answers behind this unseen transitioning point.

But the best-case scenario still makes me very excited.",25,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c1qqy9,"Some thoughts, hypotheticals, and questions regarding the BOTW sequel trailer:","-I‚Äôm not totally convinced the shots of Zelda and Link exploring the caverns with the luminous stones and Zonai architecture is a part of the journey to where they come upon the corpse room. They could be shots from a scene before or after the shots of them discovering the body. 


-What if Hyrule castle rising is Hylia in defense mode like she was when she raised Skyloft? Will more areas of the map raise somehow? 


-The vibe I get from the trailer tells me that we are probably going to be underground the majority of the game or at least for long periods of time. I feel that we are going to get a huge Zelda dungeon fix in this game and they are going to be expansive underground dungeons across the BOTW map. Also, I believe that the landscape on the surface world will have changed somewhat drastically, maybe the after effects from the castle rising that triggers quakes and what not. 


-Why do I keep thinking that the Great Plateau has a massive dungeon underground?  The way the walls of the plateau are built might suggest it. Maybe it‚Äôll be our starting dungeon? 


-BOTW was definitely magical, but it primarily revolved around technology for its story line. In the trailer we see no signs of any Sheikah tech. The only thing we see is a glowing, bluish-green hand and arm emanating green wisps of Gerudo lettering that is mobile, sentient, and affects Link somehow. The Sheikah tech obviously failed to seal all the Malice. Since technology failed, maybe it‚Äôs time to turn back to the magical ways of sealing evil. Maybe Nintendo is playing on themes of too much reliance on technology? Could be an interesting theme to explore in the BOTW world and lore. 


-Could the magical hand be the next main game mechanic like the Sheikah slate was? 


-I feel if the body was that of Demise, we‚Äôd see Malice flowing out of his head like hair? Instead we clearly see an actual head of red hair. This is most likely the Gerudo form of Ganon from the body‚Äôs jewelry, symbols, and forehead jewel piece. As far as which Ganondorf it could be, who knows at this point? 


-The markings on the spikes in the corpse room don‚Äôt look Sheikah to me. 


-The shots of Zelda and the body with the glowing malice red embers all over the room reminds me of the blood moon. Maybe the power of the blood moon was never destroyed in the prior game? Could be a nod to MM‚Äôs moon being that the sequel is going to be darker like MM was. The blood moon maybe helped the corpse reanimate? The blood moon was never really explored much in BOTW, but it was definitely a prominent mechanic throughout the game. 


-Regardless of how it could happen, I hope we see and interact with Zelda a lot. I definitely enjoyed her character in BOTW. I admittedly subscribe to the short-haired Zelda hype, but regardless, does the length of her hair truly affect the experience? This sequel has so much potential to be truly phenomenal. 


-I hope the entire OST is as creepy as the music was for the trailer. Honestly, I hope the entire game is creepy or at least unsettling. 


-It could just be an aesthetic choice, but the Zonai are pretty prominent in the trailer. Well, their architecture is at least. Could be something or nothing.

truezelda,t3_c1o3yg,My Yiga/Gerudo war theory for BotW 2,"Now, I know there‚Äôs a lot of heavy conclusions that the trailer showed ya some type of Zonai magic because they were magic wielders, all their ruins were down there, and a lot of other convincing evidence. But I have a different spin.

Notice how there‚Äôs so many (what seems to be) luminous stones down there in the labyrinth they‚Äôre in? Luminous stones are said to ‚Äúcontain the spirits of the dead‚Äù. So it seems that with all those amounts of luminous stones, plenty of people had died. Like a lot. Maybe a war happened in there? My theory goes a bit like this. 

This is my own theory that I feel would be the most accurate, then again I could totally be wrong. I believe that because the Gerudo and Yiga Have been long at war, it would make sense that the Yiga Quite possibly were in the middle of trying to resurrect the evil demon king. 
     
    This would explain why the corpse was dressed and burial traditional garbs such as the monks that you find in the shrines. Although, because Ganondorf was a gerudo, he still had all the symbolic jewelry. Now, where did we get the slab with the same symbol on it? Well I small, but very far-fetched, theory is that Yiga stole the corpse of Ganondorf from the gerudo in order to revive it. 

    It‚Äôs quite possible that they succeeded and starting the resurrection until they were interrupted by Gerudo forces. The next thing that would happen is a battle was inflamed between the two cultures. This would explain why there are so many luminous stones . And it would make sense that there was a battle to stop the resurrection and to keep the resurrection going between these two parties and due to all of their deaths that is why there are so many Luminous stones in this labyrinth. 

     In the end, the Gerudo win the fight and place a seal on the corpse that looked as if it was in the middle of resurrection. Now, we get into how does the bright green hand relate to that of the Gerudo? Well, it is said that they don‚Äôt believe in the same religion as the Hylians, or in the goddess Hylia, rather worshipping their own Goddess. The bright green hand seems to be the same coloration of lightning that Champion Urbosa wa capable of producing. 

    Just like a Zelda is the reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, The same princess is from the tribe of the Gerudo have their own sealing power. Demise however put a curse on the spirit of the hero in the spirit of Hylia, not the Gerudo. But, with Ganondorf being reincarnated as a Gerudo so many times, it is not crazy to think they develop some sort of magic see you to keep the evil demon king away. 

  This green magic seal that roughly spells out the same text as Gerudo, what all definitely makes sense if it was some sort of divine power has down through generations of Gerudo princesses just like Zelda and Hylia. Now you‚Äôre probably asking yourself, ‚Äúhow do the Zonai fit into all of this?‚Äú And the answer is, well, they really don‚Äôt for *THIS* theory. I couldn‚Äôt quite find any reason for influence by them in this theory besides the fact that the Yiga attempted the resurrection in one of their labyrinths. This means that those wall paintings, might not even be related to Ganondorf himself but just symbolize a leader of the once present but now extinct tribe. 

However it could quite possibly be that the Zonai AND Gerudo went to war, by why would the Yiga have any plan on taking the corpse into the enemy base? There‚Äôs a lot of flaws but I figured you guys might like the thought.",17,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c1g087,Dragons in BotW 2,"Dragons were an awe inspiring addition to Breath of the Wild's world but they were, in my opinion, underutilized.  Id love to see them play a bigger role in this upcoming sequal.
  
BotW 2 is going to have a darker theme so i think we will finally see the spooky enemies in the zelda universe, poes, stalfoes, redeads, etc.  The dragons in BotW are also spirits so their more prominent role would make sense in the haunted sequal.
  
Theres a small chance we've already seen one of the dragons in BotW 2's trailer.  The green arm attempting to seal gannons corruption has some serious claws, maybe they are talons.  Probably grown out finger nails but when you see the shadow they very much look like curved talons.
  
Farosh is the dragon named after the goddess Farore, the goddess of courage.  He has a green glow and green skin in BotW.  The spirit arm could be a gift he gave link, maybe even a curse.  Id like to think it was a blessing because link represents courage so in that way Farosh and Link are connected.  Link is definately connected to the green magic, we see it posess his right hand in the trailer.  Maybe it decides to connect with link because both he and the spirit are Farore's acolytes.
  
Link being connected to a dragon spirit could lead to some very interesting gameplay mechanics and i dont think we've seen anything like it yet in the series.

truezelda,t3_c1bh09,Why are so many people against LoZ being LoZ?,"I can‚Äôt understand why people seem to be so sick of LoZ sticking to what makes it LoZ. Many people are somehow bored of fighting Ganondorf, even though he isn‚Äôt in the majority of the games. People are also somehow bored of playing as Link and bored of rescuing Zelda. They are bored of the formula I fell in love with. The formula that keeps me returning to LoZ.

Some of the theories about Zelda being the main protagonist, a switchable character, a constant companion, or co-op playable, seem like such a desperate stretch to force something into the game that doesn‚Äôt feel at all necessary to me. Many of the suggestions are adding gameplay mechanics that would detract from the sense of immersion that is one of the main goals of LoZ and would turn it into a type of game that *already exists in other series.* Like the Dragon‚Äôs Dogma-style companion gameplay that has been suggested, where Zelda follows you everywhere and casts spells at enemies and buffs on you. This would be so annoying to me after about 5 minutes. Why do so many people want such drastic changes that would make the game unrecognizable from LoZ games of the past when the type of gameplay they are suggesting already exists in other games?

If I ever get sick of playing LoZ *I start playing a different game!* I love the LoZ for all of the ‚ÄòZelda elements‚Äô that have made it unique in the past. This is why I grab it off the shelf, both in store and at home, to play again and again. With so many other games in the world I can‚Äôt understand why people seem so desperate for LoZ to be less like LoZ and more like other games that already exist. Let me play as Link collecting 3 ‚Äòtalismans‚Äô to unlock the Master Sword that reveals the ‚Äòsecond world‚Äô where I have to rescue 5-7 ‚Äòsages‚Äô in order to rescue Zelda from Ganondorf in damn near every LoZ game until the end of time and I will be a happy man. If I get sick of this for a while I will simply play a different game until my Zelda cravings come back.

truezelda,t3_c1qn6j,Curious about Ganondorf's childhood in OoT,"Recently some theory that was bouncing around my head mad eme think back to a conversation I had with my sister about why Ganondorf is an interesting villain.

I was talking about Ganondorf's subtext. In particular the subtext in OoT and WW. Since we know these Ganondorfs are the same incarnation. In WW before the final battle Ganondorf says something that immediately changed my opinion of him as a character. He starts talking about what it was like in the gerudo desert. And how he hated and coveted the power of the wind. It made me think about what his childhood would be like, before he realized his potential as ""The King of Evil"". 

He was just a kid, growing up in a culture populated entirely by women sequestered in the harsh environment of the Gerudo desert. I'm sure he was raised as privaleged as possible, and taught magic and how to be a ruler by his ""surrogate mothers"" the witches Koume and Kotake. What happened to his mother? Did she die in childbirth? Who was the father? He would have never known the love of a family.

Groomed as a child to be the king of a tribe of career bandits, he would have traveled, perhaps diplomatically (as he later pretends to do when Link sees him as an adult with Zelda) to Hyrule. He would have seen how opulantly they live. At least compared to the Gerudo, the Hylians are a very safe and well-off people. He definitely would have been envious... they got like... two cities and a ranch... how bourgeois... lol.

Anyway. It makes me wonder. Was he really BORN to be the inheritor of demise's curse? Or was he somehow chosen? He would have naturally resented the kingdom of Hyrule anyway.  Perhaps to the extent that he would have attempted conquering it anyway. He succeeded before he even had the Triforce, afterall.

To me that type of character is more interesting then a man born to be evil for the sake of hording power. Maybe in a future game if we see Ganondorf again he will have reincarnated, perhaps as a gerudo, and we will have a chance to see him BECOME the King of Evil, instead of being told that he is. And having to take Nintendo's word for it. Maybe he fights against the curse. Maybe instead of an old man, he's the same age as Link and they respect each other. 

Idk. That's fanfiction-esque and I'm not that type of guy. But I always thought that Ganondorf was becoming more developed as a character, and then in BotW they made him a spooky cloud. I was dissappinted...

THE REASON WHY I BROUGHT IT UP: I'm sure it's been mentioned before but, the Gerudo in BotW showed shame and regret for Ganondorf having been born into their tribe in the past. But a man is born to the gerudo tribe every 100 years. And that man is destined to become king of the tribe. Which means in the upcoming breath of the wild sequel, since Link was asleep for 100 years, and there was no man alive in the gerudo tribe during that time period as far as we know (or at least that I know, maybe I'm an idiot and missed something important)... There should be another born, perhaps in the next game... 

Maybe that hand was just keeping Ganon's spirit there. And if he truly is dead, the chance exists that he can be reincarnated. Perhaps into something that is synonymous with his past life.

TLDR; Ganon had the opportunity to be a cool and potentially relatable character in OoT-WW. Also, I'm speculating he might be dead and reincarnated into a new male Gerudo baby soon to be born. &lt;.1% chance this is what they're going for but fun for me to think about anyways.",2,public,,0

Remember how we felt seeing the Temple of Time in the BOTW story trailer, for it to not be important at all?

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like all of these theories about Twili or Demise aren't going to be supported by anything in the game, as with the theories made for BOTW before release.

So after viewing the collar on Ganondorf and looking at the motif of the Zonai, I wonder if there is some connection between them.

truezelda,t3_c1efvw,Hyrule Underground,"So I‚Äôm sure this has already been covered...I tried to read some previous threads but there was too much to look though, but I was curious on people‚Äôs thoughts of what Hyrule is going to look like in the new BoTW.

I assume they‚Äôre not going to reuse the same map completely...so how will they change it to make it palatable for a second go around? 

I think part of the game will be heavily focused underground. The trailer is almost 100% underground so I think that will be a central focus of the game. I think this would be a good step as BoTW lacked that certain ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô aesthetic that has marked a number of LoZ games. And BoTW really didn‚Äôt do any large caverns, so it would be a new atmosphere for that engine.

I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôll treat the ‚Äúoverworld‚Äù of Hyrule. It certainly doesn‚Äôt look more urbanized based on that outside scene in the trailer, but potentially places like Hateno and LaLurein are now large towns.

truezelda,t3_c19phl,Is A Link to the Past worth it if I've already played A Link Between Worlds?,"A couple months ago I set out to play every Legend of Zelda game. I've already completed most of the 3D games, so this mainly meant getting the 2D titles under my belt. I started from the beginning, with The Legend of Zelda NES. Suffice to say I hated it. Call me soft, but with my Gen Z sensibilities I just couldn't get on with the game's technological limitations and rudimentary level design (my favourite Zelda game is Skyward Sword for crying out loud). I struggled through it regardless, as a matter of pride, but did not enjoy it. Adventure of Link was a little better in my opinion, but still not my cup of tea. 

That may have seemed irrelevant but I wanted to highlight how much I can struggle with really old games. (""Really old"" here means ""older than me"", and I was born in 1999.) On the other hand I finished Link's Awakening yesterday and I liked it a lot. I could tolerate the old graphics because you can move in any direction and the story and dungeons are good. 

So yeah, I'm asking any retro Zelda fans out there if you think I'd enjoy A Link to the Past. I know it was a pivotal step for the series, but I've already played A Link Between Worlds and I've been told it's practically the same thing but better-looking and with extra levels. I fear that if I buy A Link to the Past, it'll feel like the same game but stripped down and harder to control. And also uglier. 

Is there anything really wonderful in ALttP that you can't get the same fix of from ALBW? If so, then I'll shell out the 8 quid or so and buy it on VC.

truezelda,t3_c1jkxy,BotW2 Predictions: Zelda will be a playable protagonist (and other non-Ganoncorpse predications),"I bet someone else on the internet has been talking about this but I haven't seen it here.

I decided to ~~procrastinate~~ rewatch the BotW2 trailer today and I noticed something. Zelda features pretty damn prominently for a character who, traditionally, only appears for a few moments in each game and then shows up at the end. I've taken screenshots of every shot that includes Link or Zelda.

The first third of the trailer has [lots of shots of Zelda and Link walking through caves.](https://imgur.com/a/KmR4K3t) The thing that really strikes me is how prominently Zelda is placed in some of these. In shots that show Link or Zelda, they are always shown together. In far shots, they are shown roughly as prominently, but there's that one close shot that really puts Zelda in the forefront.

[Link only has one shot without Zelda](https://imgur.com/a/EmDtwY5) - and this shot is of Link in a vulnerable position, his arm being overrun with some sort of magical effect. I'm not quite sure whether this is a new magical power that Link will wield, or whether he will be using this power to hold Ganoncorpse back much as Zelda did in BotW.

Two more very interesting shots follow. [Link and Zelda](https://imgur.com/a/YQuYdtG) grab each other's hand (Zelda's glove is the one below with the gold circles on the knuckles). This seems to symbolize Link and Zelda working together - but almost immediately after, one of our protagonists (I can't tell which from the angle) [is grabbed by Glowy Dead Hand](https://imgur.com/a/Mivjzcn). This might be setting up to suggest that the teamwork between Link and Zelda is broken, as they are bound by whatever force this glowy hand belongs to.

[Zelda falls down](https://imgur.com/a/nBHzzDL) - I'm not sure if this is actually immediately before the 'Link and Zelda grab hands' shot from earlier, but it suggests the two become separated (possibly before Link gets his new glowy hand?) Note that Zelda is more prominent than Link here.

The last two shots featuring either protagonist are of [Zelda](https://imgur.com/a/Zm53x3n). The first one looks particularly defiant and heroic, while the last shot of her makes her look more startled or afraid.

Now, I might be overanalyzing a trailer, but in 2019 I have come to expect trailers to give us a decent idea of what to expect from any given piece of media. This looks to be a game about exploring caves and uncovering the evil plots of dead kings, but it's also a game that looks to focus more on Zelda than Link. Link and Zelda will be separated - probably immediately before Link gets glowy-handed - and then the focus shifts to Zelda as she attempts to reunite with him.

Everyone keeps saying that this is gonna be a darker game and is gonna be the Majora's mask to botw's ocarina of time.

But what if it's the opposite? What if botw is Majora's Mask? In botw, you travel to 4 regions, fight 4 evil beings, and free 4 giants (divine beasts). When the giants are freed, they shoot their beams towards the castle in the ""center"" of the map, towards the thing that threatens the world. Similar to MM where you free the giants who come together to stop the moon, the thing that threatens the world, from crashing into clocktown, the central location of Termina.

Also in botw, we're introduced to the present day versions of the champions who admittedly don't play a huge role in the game. But there's about 6 of them: Riju (Gerudo), Teba (Rito), Yunobo (Goron), Sidon (Zora), maybe Paya (Sheikah), and maybe Hestu (Korok). These could be parallels for the 6 sages you have to find and Zelda could be the 7th like in OoT. Just some speculation. I hope we get some massive dungeons back.

truezelda,t3_c19tii,BotW 2 key story point?,"I was looking through the new trailer for any information I could find, when I stumbled upon this very interesting detail others seem to have missed. In the scene in the trailer where Link is seemingly struggling with the ghostly hand we've seen before, you can notice that it appears to have enveloped his arm, giving his hand an ethereal quality. This, we all know. What I think we've missed, is that, if we look very closely at the scene, we can see, roughly halfway up Link's forearm, what appears to be a darker end point, beyond which, we cannot see any of Link's natural flesh. Given the way the arm appears to end in a stump, I believe that, at this point in the game, Link has lost his right arm. For whatever reason, the hand is functioning as a replacement, and I believe the scene we are seeing to be the binding of the ghost hand to Link's arm. I believe that this is more than a theory. In concept art for BotW, we see a version of Link without an arm. We also know that Breath of the Wild has received much inspiration from Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke, in which the character Ashitaka loses his hand due to the presence of demons (I never saw the movie). The image we see, and the pieces of information we have been fed on the way, all point in the direction of this conclusion.

Some of my own examples are:

- Allowing the player the mark certain clothing pieces as 'Favourites' that you can filter for to make going back to your 'default' clothes faster when your no longer in an area that require certain clothes (such as the Rito gear for cold areas).

- Adding a map filter that would add the boundaries for the various regions.

- Make players able to hide already completed quests on the quest menu (maybe also have a tab exclusively for DLC quests as those currently clog up so much).",6,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c11zpf,Some semi-qualified speculations about the release date of Breath of the Wild-sequel,"These are mostly some thoughts I have had regarding a possible release date of the recently teased Breath of the Wild-sequel, and wanted some response on them. I should add that I know very little of game development as I have no experience of it; those are just some thoughts and guesses I would consider semi-qualified.

The time cycle between a 3D Zelda game and the next 3D Zelda has consistently been at least four year ever since The Wind Waker was released, but seeing how this sequel will reuse a lot of the assets from Breath of the Wild, it is in my opinion a reasonable assumption that the time between release of Breath of the Wild to the release of this teased sequel, will perhaps be slightly shorter; I think most everyone here has had this thought.

However I also wanted to bring some other facts to mind about a potential release date. When Breath of the Wild was developed from scratch as Zelda U, the initial release plan was to launch in 2015, but this launch was delayed, presumably due to technical difficulties. The launch was then scheduled to early 2016, [as stated by Fujibayashi](https://youtu.be/30jGWna4-Ns?t=35). Another delay occured that scheduled it to coincide with the launch of the Switch, which I feel was a deliberate decision to give the console a good launch title as opposed to the game actually needing an additional year in development.

With that said about the development of Breath of the Wild, the total development time between the release of Skyward Sword (November 2011) and the early 2016 release would have originally been a little more than four years, and those four years would have included the delay that was due to development issues. I feel the reusing of assets and the experience the development gained from Breath of the Wild, will let them shave of a considerable amount of the usual development time, so that perhaps the total time passed between Breath of the Wild and it's sequel will be perhaps 3,5 years and I definitely feel like a 2020 release is clearly within the realm of possibility. Additionally the developers seem to have decided on a story (the trailer reveals that they most likely have decided on the bad guy and the main quest), which is what Nintendo usually does last, indicating that they're good on their way through development (thanks to Serbaayuu for reminding me of this).

These are basically my thoughts, and summarized I would expect a early 2021 release as the latest. Does anyone agree/disagree or have anything else to add to my reasoning that I forgot about?",17,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c0zq96,Breath of the Wild takes place in the Downfall Timeline.,"**The following contains spoilers for Breath of the Wild, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time, and a Link to the Past.**

---

*This may seem like common sense to most of you but I still see people popping up saying ""ThE TiMeLiNeS CoNvErGeD"" or ""Zelda said Twilight so it's after TP"" or similar.*

---

Here's a piece of text taken from one of the **Zora stone monuments** in Breath of the Wild.

&gt;Long, long ago... In a past more distant than even the Great Calamity or the creation of the Divine Beast Vah Ruta... There was a Zora princess named Ruto. We know that she was an attendant to the Zora patron deity and that she was a fair and lively girl, beloved to all. Around that same time, an evil man with designs on ruling the world appeared, bring disaster upon Zora's Domain. It is said that **Ruto awoke as a sage facing this foe alongside the princess of Hyrule and the hero of legend**. Her achievements are remembered not only by the Zora, they are forever etched in the history of Hyrule. The Divine Beast Vah Ruta, built ages later to face off against Calamity Ganon, was named in honor of Ruto. That the Zora princess-my sweet daughter Mipha-was chosen to pilot Ruta is surely the work of fate.

This text confirms that BotW takes place after a time in which:

* Ruto was awakened as a sage
* Ruto fought Ganondorf. 

Through events in the game we also see that Hyrule... *exists*. This combination of things is only possible in one timeline.

**Adult Timeline**

* ***[Hyrule was washed away by a Triforce wish](https://youtu.be/pH0edL96ZsY?t=3m36s), Breath of the Wild takes place in Hyrule.***

**Child Timeline**

* [**Ganondorf was caught and sent to the Arbiter's Grounds before he could do anything.**](https://youtu.be/BVYggDnaJgY)
* ***Ruto was never awakened as a sage because the old sages were never killed.***

**Downfall Timeline**

* [Ruto and the other sages were awakened and fought Ganon](https://youtu.be/0jWRf8x1DTY)
* There are towns named after the OoT sages in Zelda 2
* This is one of only two timelines where Hyrule still exists.
* The Royal Family appears to have the entire Triforce in their possession (By the time of BotW this appears to have been the case for so long that they don't even really know what it is anymore)

Zelda saying the word ""Twilight"" also doesn't mean that the game takes place after TP. The Twili were sealed off in the Twilight Realm before the events of OoT. The Twilight and its inhabitants exist in all three timelines.

truezelda,t3_c198fz,art of hylian shields vs dark link shield,"I've been trying to understand by doing a bit of research on my own but I give up!  I've seen different versions of the hylian shield vs dark link shield and at the same time, I've seen them looking the same!  

Is it really just the dark color scheme and they are the same design?  I'd like to believe that the initial images I found for dark link were different for a reason but then I began to see the hylian shield with identical patterns. 

Maybe this is just the change of design throughout the games as I've read about but I'm looking for clarification here before I commit any tattoos.

Im new to reddit and am not sure why I can't reply on an old thread discussing the shields, game to game.. Or post an image for simplifying my problem but I'll attempt to describe.. 

If you look at the triforce there is an outline around it on TP version.  Looking at the hylian crest, there is also a hole in the head of the crimson loftwing (also Tp I think)...  But my biggest question... Is regarding the bottom of the shield depicting a different crest altogether. I thought the versions where it is not the original crimson loftwing, it appears to be split in the bottom and has a hole in the head.  Don't know wtf this is even supposed to be.. To my first impressions, THIS has always been what I assumed to be the dark link version but I have seen many of that design with the hero's color scheme applied, as well as many dark shields with the exact same design as the hero..  

WHICH IS WHICH??!  does it matter?  I have to assume that this ""different"" design would be dark link but I cannot find any info regarding this piece to help me commit to a decision.  

I would love to add pictures if I figure out why I can't right now but I hope this description makes enough sense.   Thanks.",0,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c14yhz,Advice on going through all the games,"Originally posted this to r/Zelda but thought y'all might be able to help me too:

Hey everyone!

Since the BOTW 2 announcement I have been hyped enough to want to binge the series through. I have always been a fan, but I have never played many of the games, and many of the ones I have played, I've never finished. So I decided to go through all the mainline Zeldas to see how the series evolved, and I'm enjoying it - currently playing A Link to the Past for the first time.

As I was forming my list, though, I hit a point of contention in the form of the Four Swords games, and their spiritual successor Tri Force Heroes. I don't really have anyone to play these games with - might be able to convince my girlfriend to play Four Swords/Adventure with me but she doesn't have a 3DS so Tri Force Heroes would definitely have to be solo. And I've always seen them as kind of spin-offs and never had much interest in them. I own Four Swords Anniversary on the 3DS from back when it was available on the eShop and think I could get Adventures and Tri Force Heroes pretty easy, but are they worth it for a mostly solo experience? I've been going back and forth on this so I was hoping to get some feedback from people who love the series. Thanks!",4,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c11f7q,An interesting theory video about ganon from Botw 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUaKoAFs1H8,8,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c0zkrr,[Theory] Ganondorf in Botw2,"Okay gang so. Ive been thinking a lot about the trailer and all the little things people have been noticing. So lets start at when.
‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†

Botw and its sequal have a spot in the timeline. We were told its way at the end. Now we already have this wierd split timeline and such so. Why not split it some more? Or.. assume the endings of the late games.. arent the right ones.
In the three end games of the timeline, Ganon only returns in one, The four swords adventure.
However. If Link perishes in Links Adventure, Ganon also returns. The last of these three latter games is Spirit Tracks, In it you fight a demon named Malladus, which sure thats not ganon! At first thought.. See Malladus, Like Ganon. Has a title... and its the same exact title. Demon King. He also just, outright looks like Beast ganon in the final fight, but yknow, as if Ganon had to possess someone that wasnt Ganondorf.

But now with all that in mind. Lets move to what I think happened, 10,000 years before Botw.
‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†

This, as we were told, is when the previous Zelda and team sealed Ganon away. I want you to look at that Mural that Impa shows us as you read along with this, it will better help you understand what I am thinking and going for.

In the Mural, what is shown, is a shadow covered beast ganon, fighting against what looks like a red headed man in all green armor. Sporting a green blade that, doesnt really have the shape of the master sword.
It also shows off every single person, fighting against ganon, you have all of the Guardians, all of the Divine Beasts, you can see people at the top though, on the left it looks like a small race fleeing to the woods. Likely the Kokiri elves leaving to later become the Koroks. And then to the too right you see, the king of Hyrule. In a room alongside with several Shiekah and a mysterious machine.
Leading me to think that, its likely that Hyrule castle IS a Divine Beast. Which is why it looks to be raising or at least moving in the botw2 trailer.

What else do we see though? Zelda, using her magics from behind Ganon, and. Mysterious hero.

Well what if this hero, isnt link, a lot of people are trying to explain how it is via in game armors and equipment but, the dead give away, is that his sword in this mural, is definately not the mastersword, it looks more like a Gladius than a Short sword. But note, all of his armor, aside from his legs, are this off greenish blue color. I think that both weapon and armor this hero is wearing is the first makes of Guardian gear.
Now his hair, thats a dead giveaway but, look at his hand, its also red, and yet, theres gold weaved into it. Likely to not reveal yet that.

This hero, IS Ganondorf.

Now why is he the hero?

Link died. Not just.. any link. The Link from Links adventure. This brought the revival of Ganon. Who sure was keeping Zelda asleep in that game but what if when he came back she awoke, gathered all the clans and the Shiekah, and got to work? 
See Links awakening is one of the very few Zelda games that show off an electronic style device, that we see in Botw.

The Elevators, which are only in shrines/temples in Links Adventure.. and again are only in shrines in Botw.
Anyway lets continue.

Link died, Ganon returned, Zelda rallied the people of Hyrule. Now were told that Ganon was messing the world up for A WHILE. Which explains a small time gap for the Shiekah to refine the guardian tech. But they needed a hero. Link, the usual hero, the man with the triforce of curage's blessing is gone. But who else ressurects with Zelda? One of two people, Impa, and Ganon. Now who knows what Impa was up to but.. Ganondorf, well he likely lived in whatever the Gerudo town was in Links Adventure (I would say Nabooru here. But we dont know because of console limitations and nintendo not having quite a grand idea for LoZ yet)

So I think Zeldo goes with Impa to train Ganon, all the while telling him of his previous incarnations. How each and every one succumbed to the possession of his body. And each and every one had to die to seal Ganondorf.
With all of this I think they came up with a plan. Or at least.. a backup plan. To seal Ganon inside of Ganondorf, and rush him into stasis to keep him from waking.

Of course though.. as all of the guardian tech would be, the stasis machine, isnt fully hammered out yet. Not like the one we start at in botw. No surely that one was made, just in case, and at a much later date. So Ganondorfs stasis, had some leaks, some weaknesses. Which is how Calamity slowly leaked from him.

Now in the trailer for botw2. We see the arm that has sealed Ganondorf, go into link. And a lot of people assume he is A) Going to lose an arm and B) that the magic arm was his.

Well likely, it wasnt, likely it was zeldas, used to seal Ganon because they didnt have the mastersword. And likely it goes into Links arm, because he is absolutely the person who would touch the arm out of curiosity
‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†

Overall I think
Botw is at the end of all timelines, but primarily Links adventure
Ganondorf was the hero that fought the beast Ganon 10,000 years before botw.

Hyrule Castle is a divine beast, mostly because the mural shows all divine beasts, and there were 5 heroes. Dont tell me the motorcycle was Links Divine Beast.

truezelda,t3_c0uftd,My idea for a modern Downfall timeline Ganondorf (assuming BotW takes place in the Downfall timeline),"I'm of the opinion that the most likely placement for Breath of the Wild in the timeline, and by extension, Breath of the Wild 2 is the downfall timeline.

Breaking down why that is has been done thousands of times around here before, but it did get me thinking now that we've seen Ganondorf in BotW2.

My main problem for with Ganondorf at this point in the Downfall timeline is that Ganon had his mind broken in his resurrection in the Oracles, and created a mindless, raging Ganon that only knew destruction. Now that works nicely for what it needed to do at the time, which was get Ganon from A (OoT and LttP, where he's intelligent and speaks) to B (LoZ where he doesn't say a word), but it does create a problem moving forward with him in games that take place after LoZ and AoL. It doesn't make for a very compelling bad guy.

So I think, like the Child Timeline before it with FSA, it's time for the Downfall Timeline to get a new reincarnation of Ganondorf. But I think this would be a very different man to what we've seen before. 

Ganon has absolutely ravaged the Downfall timeline time and time again. We know the Gerudo are aware of his origins too, and from Ubrosa's speech in BotW, we know they aren't exactly thrilled about it. They're a pretty proud race too, so it seems like they probably do have a fair degree of loathing for Ganon.

This is the environment that a new Ganondorf would be born into and raised in. This total hatred for his predecessor would be ingrained into him. Probably more so him than his people to be honest, since he's the Gerudo male.

It would be interesting to see him have these dark tenancies that he's actively working against. Genuinely wanting to be a good person/king, but always having that struggle against the Ganon part of him.

Eventually that dichotomy would lead to a split between Ganondorf and Ganon, which would lead to the original Calamity 10 000 years ago, with Ganondorf having to fight the evil side of himself with the Princess and the Champions. This would make Ganondorf the hero depicted in the tapestry.

The fight would end with Ganon being sealed in Ganondorf's body, and Ganondorf himself sealed underneath Hyrule Castle, where he eventually becomes the mummified corpse (Shiekah style) that we see in the trailer.

Definitely not the only way they could do it, but just some thoughts I had since the new trailer has a lot going on.",18,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c0seab,[BoTW2] Is Ganondorf's resting place actually Gerudo and not Zonai?,"Most people have jumped to the conclusion that it is Zonai, which is reasonable given it's architecture, but there is also a whole lot of stuff telling me it's Gerudo. First of a there is the large emphasis on his Gerudoness, which can be seen in the fact that there is a Gerudo symbol on his jewelry and what seems to be part of his clothing has a Gerudo symbol on it. That alone isn't enough too prove it though, which is were the next piece of evidence comes in: spirits. The color of luminous stone can be seen on the ghosts of the Champions and luminous stone is said have the souls of the dead trapped in side so I think we can firmly say that color is the color of spirits. Now that color can be seen on the hand keeping Ganondorf down (which already does look kind of Gerudo), meaning it likely has something to do with spirits. Now your probably asking how this connected to the Gerudo. Well, the Gerudo have a lot of connections with spirits in OOT with the Spirit Temple and Nabooru being the Sage of Spirit. The caves leading up to the resting place also have a lot of luminous stones, but that could be purely aesthetical. The third part of my theory is that the symbols made by the Spirit energy have been observed to be similar too the agerueo script. Now this is by no means confirm Ed and they could be part of another script or even just random symbols, but I still think it is worth noting. Now is does this confirm anything? No. Parts of Faron (the home of the Zonai) have a lot of luminous stone, so it could just be in support of the place being Zonai. But I still think it all is worth noting and makes for an interesting theory, and we can still gain stuff from it even if it is ultimately false. Specifically the hand being connected with spirits is interested in and of itself. Also please leave your thoughts on the comments, I'm interested in hearing them.",19,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c0rpac,CoH: A collection of timeline-related evidence for a game that isn't even canon,"Please forgive the atrocious quality of the pictures of my switch that I took on my phone.

The first interesting tidbit that I found in this game is the [Hero's Shield](https://imgur.com/a/AhpTmMN) from the Wind Waker. This shield can be found mounted on the wall of a house in Kakariko Village, as well as in [Gerudo Town](https://imgur.com/a/iXoUim2). This doesn't conclusively place the game in any particular timeline as the Hero's Shield is a historic shield, but it's commonly associated with the Adult Timeline. For a time, I wondered if CoH might be set in Hyrule before it was flooded.

[Various groups](https://imgur.com/a/1lhTG5g) can also be seen in CoH. Gerudo Town seems to be thriving (and welcoming male visitors), there is at least one Goron storeowner, and there are numerous 'River' Zora (both friendly and aggressive!) I wondered if this might place it after FSA, or perhaps in the centuries leading up to BotW. The tribes of Hyrule seem to come and go between games, but it's always worth giving their appearance a little consideration.

And then there's [this](https://imgur.com/a/SUeP5ue) tidbit about the Kokiri Sword! One of the most powerful 'daggers' in the game, the text mentions the Kokiri Sword is meant for a 'future' hero. The only hero who has used the Kokiri Sword that we know of is the Hero of Time, and he carried it with him on two different adventures. Perhaps this game is set before Ocarina of Time.(If so, where are the Kokiri and why is the sword in Hyrule Castle?)

I didn't take pictures, but the largest evidence is the existence of Ganon (not Ganondorf). Seemingly he's intelligent enough to play the organ, so he's probably not OoX-BotW Ganon. 

Additionally, Link and Zelda seem to have the Triforces of Courage and Wisdom respectively, ruling out a placement between OoT and ALttP. I'm taking a semi-educated guess and saying that this is a post-FSA timeline placement.

~~Or maybe it's just a non-canon game that didn't make any attempts to have any timeline placement, but where's the fun in discussing that?~~",16,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c0hzae,How the sequel to Breath of the Wild lends to a theory I had... (speculation),"It has always been my theory that the Sheikah not only knew exactly how and why Ganon returns but I think they actually inadvertently ***caused*** it to happen.   


When we are told of the legend 10,000 years ago, it is told that Ganon barely had a chance against the combined forces of not only the Guardians but Link/Zelda working together to seal him away. Now if the Sheikah worked with the other factions of Hyrule to destroy Ganon then why were they banished?

&amp;#x200B;

It has been long known that Ganon or some form of him will forever appear to spread hatred throughout the world. This cycle, as far as we've seen, appears to be unbreakable.   
No matter what level of sealing magic or divine power is used. He returns.

&amp;#x200B;

So what if you could know exactly when and where he would return? What if you could manipulate this cycle to your own ends?   
This is what I believe the Sheikah attempted.   


I believe that the Sheikah tried to control Ganon and, by proxy, Malice itself. I cannot say whether their original intentions were noble but what I can say is that they definitely sought to use the power of malice to create even stronger machines. So when they beat Ganon they trapped him deep below the castle and begun to experiment. They sealed him with what we see in the trailer for the sequel and channeled his outpouring of malice into vile amalgamations of tech and dark magic (I believe this is why we see one strand of malice coiling upward toward the Shiekah architecture in some of the shots). For with the true Ganondorf sealed away, only tiny tendrils of malice can appear and are far easier to manage. Using this malice they created a Faux Ganon for the hero to destroy without fear of failure. It was then that the Hylian Royal Family discovered this plot, seeing this power to manipulate Malice as an attempt to rule all of Hyrule and a blasphemy to their way of life, and banished the Sheikah people (specifically their technology). As we know, two factions then split off this group. The current Sheikah that consist of those in Kakariko Village who shunned their own technology and, because of this, regained favour with the Royal Family. The Yiga were those who saw this as a betrayal of their loyalty throughout the years and now seek the destruction of those who shunned their ways. This is when the Four Blights are created; attempts to take back their ancient machinery from the Hylians. 

However this banishing had an unintended side effect.   
Because the Sheikah can no longer use the technology with which they sealed away Ganon, they can also no longer control the tide of Malice that flows from him. 10,000 years pass with no one to control the growth of this Faux Ganon and anyone else that knew either were already Monks sealed away in the Shrines or the Yiga Clan. It seems as if the Sheikah never reveal that they had sealed Ganon below Hyrule Castle because no other character seems to remember or understand why Ganon appears under the Castle. But it does seem as if the Sheikah knew this would eventually happen and created the Shrines and the Care unit in the Shrine of Resurrection as a way for the Hero to succeed. 

Then, while the princess and all of the champions were away from their stations, the Yiga release the Faux Ganon and his Blights into the world to wreak havoc. However, any attempts by the Yiga to take over Hyrule Castle are met with death as the Guardians controlled by Malice kill indiscriminately. Thus creating the scenario we see played out in-game.  


Onto evidence:  


So the first glaring piece of evidence toward this is the chamber in which you first face Calamity Ganon. A huge dome structure deep underground housing nothing else but the Calamity. Is this not bizarre? Why would the most evil thing to exist sit right under the nose of the very people it was trying to destroy? Well it would make sense if they weren't trying to destroy Ganon completely.   


Another is the blights. It is unknown how or why these creatures spring up immediately upon Ganon's return. Yet they seem to have not only full control of the divine beasts but also Sheikah technology embedded into their beings. You could argue that Ganon created these beings and he himself fused the Sheikah tech but that doesn't make any sense. If Ganon is still capable of critical thought then why would he and the blights be so mindless? Even with full control of the Divine beasts they wander in circles as if lost or confused. If these creatures genuinely ""thought"" about destroying Hyrule then they have had the means to do so for 100 years. Not only that, but if Ganon was still critically thinking he would have learned that Sheikah weaponry is especially effective against itself. So why would he then deck himself out in Sheikah tech rather than pure malice which literally damages anything just on contact with the substance?  


Another is the Sheikah tech itself. Is it not bizarre that the towers aren't known to anyone at all in the events leading up to the Calamity? Is it not strange that each and every shrine is dormant despite being in the presence of the hero many times? And finally, what does it mean that Maz Koshia, champion of the fifth divine beast and guardian of the Shrine of Resurrection, has access to and utilizes the weaponry and skillset of not only the Yiga but the Blights themselves? These questions can only be reconciled if we acknowledge that the Sheikah had a direct hand in not only the creation of Calamity Ganon but then, as a final attempt to save the world after being banished, created the Shrines to train the Hero.  


  
These are some thoughts on a theory that is most likely untrue. Not for any particular reason other than some of the evidence I listed could be chalked up to the ""Gamification"" of the lore. Still, I personally believe this is close to, if not the real truth of the Sheikah and Ganon based on what we see in-game. Though I'm sure there is a lot I missed.

&amp;#x200B;

truezelda,t3_c0jqak,My main concern re-using this Hyrule,"Most people seem excited about revisiting BOTW Hyrule, but I feel like I'm in the minority that finds the idea disappointing. I agree there's much to add and improve in the overworld, but with BOTW's main appeal being exploration, even a revamped Hyrule wouldn't leave the same impression.

Now if they decide to add enough cities, dungeons and other cool locations, it could obviously be 'better' than BOTW, but at the cost of making BOTW obsolete. If they improve a lot upon this existing game/overworld, BOTW will always be looked back upon as an inferior version of BOTW2. Why would we go back to the first one if the sequel expands upon everything that made it unique?

So stay with me here, as I try to explain my most contemplated area...of breath of the wild 

So imagine Ganondorf was a king, a gerudo king. A king of the gerudo village long before the one we see in Botw 

Imagine he was a ruthless killer, a power hungry evil man, who would not hesitate to kill his own men if need be.

Imagine some women in the gerudo town disliked this.

...let‚Äôs say 8 of them formed a revolution, a group. One that was silently saving towns and villages from ganondorf‚Äôs wrath.  Ganondorf was a bit mad at this group, and hunted them down, ruthlessly interrogating those who he suspected knew about this group of rebels.

Everyone knew about them, after all, none of the gerudo liked ganon. He was born male, so it was as culture to make him their king. They supported in secret the 8 heroines.

Each of the heroines wielded a sword, and was represented by a symbol worn on an orb necklace, anklet etc. 

Ganondorf prepared for his final attack on hyrule castle. The heroines had been the only souls to know what ganon was really after.

The zonai temple under the castle.

But one of the heroines was not as she seemed. She was a traitor. she told ganon of the heroines hideout location. And ganon has his Troops kill the other seven, by throwing each of them into a seemingly bottomless pit. 

The eighth heroine heard news of this, and committed suicide, as to atone for her betrayal.

The villagers of gerudo town built seven statues at a secluded area of the desert, in honor of the seven who bravely defied their king.

And the eighth statue was of the traitor. But was secluded from the rest. As to eternally punish her for her betrayal.

The heroines hideout was taken many years later by the Yiga, and master kohga met the same fate as the seven heroines.",74,public,,0

truezelda,t3_c0e1a4,I feel people are setting themselves up for disappointment already for Breath of the Wild 2.,"Now look, I wouldn't mind playing as Princess Zelda as an extra in the end.

The one problem I have is the amount of people who are almost demanding that Zelda is playable after watching a less than two minute trailer.

The worst thing will be the ""journalists"" who do the same thing but instead of venting on reddit they get to publish an article on an official website calling the developers out for not letting them play as Zelda (despite the fact that no other mainline games has ever let you play as Zelda).

I've seen some people say that it could just be that Zelda follows along with you for most of the game but the issue there is I don't think they could allow for the same traversal as BOTW because I don't know the pathfinding would work when a player spends 20 minutes climbing a mountain. It can't think how it could work well in an open world game.

But who knows though. I'm still excited to see what happens and I will play anything Nintendo dishes out as long as it's good but two important questions I have for you are , do you want Princess Zelda to be playable, why or why not?

truezelda,t3_c0ftfq,Hyrule Castle (in BotW) is a space ship - prove me wrong,"... I know, that title sounds ridiculous and makes me look like one of the uneducated common people, but please hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with some backstory. As of BotW, the Sheikah have been shown to possess a great deal of knowledge and understanding of the world, so much so that their technology is often mistaken for the power of the gods. We know they had the intellect to build things like the Sheikah Slate, and their technology helped Hyrule to ascend as a technologically advanced civilization 10,000 years ago. In fact, their technology was so powerful that it overwhelmed Ganon when he emerged during the first Great Calamity, and how that event unfolded is actually quite impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

From what we can piece together, the Sheikah built 15 towers all over the kingdom that were meant to act as radar to detect the emergence of Calamity Ganon:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*It is said that the fifteen Sheikah Towers were to act like radar to detect signs of Calamity Ganon's reappearance as quickly as possible.""* ‚Äî Creating a Champion, pg. 367

&amp;#x200B;

Once Calamity Ganon was detected by the towers, 5 pillars rose from below Hyrule Castle and burst with Guardians, all of which swarmed Ganon in an attempt to weaken him and to protect the hero:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Robbie has restored mobility to many of  the Guardians we've excavated. ...But we have still yet to find all of the Guardians. Records mention a greater number of them‚Äîand even other types. They are said to be stored in five giant columns that rest  beneath Hyrule Castle. The thing is... No matter how I search beneath the castle, I can't seem to locate these columns. They must be buried deep. Were they perhaps designed to sense the appearance of Calamity Ganon and to only activate upon his return?* ‚Äî Zelda's Research Notes 

&amp;#x200B;

While Ganon was busy being pew pew'd by the Guardian swarm, 4 Divine Beasts, piloted by the Champions of that era, launched powerful beam attacks on him. The sheer firepower weakened him so much that he stood no chance against the hero and the princess with their Master Sword and Sealing Power aka Triforce.

&amp;#x200B;

Ganon was sealed without barely making a scratch to Hyrule, and all seemed well... but somehow the Sheikah knew better. Along with the towers, pillars and Divine Beasts, they also built 120 shrines (or 136 if you count DLC) 10,000 years ago, which curiously served no role in the Great Calamity, as far as we know. Instead, they served as trials for the current hero in the second Great Calamity. Even more interesting is that many of them were designed to reward Link only upon meeting very specific criteria, such as giving a Gerudo some alcohol and having Link and some dude stand on two pedestals at once. I happen to believe that this insanely accurate ability to predict the future is the result of a [blessing given to their ancestors by Hylia](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/4ofxnu/the_true_origins_and_nature_of_the_sheikah_has/), and it's entirely possible they saw more than just the first and second Great Calamities approaching with these abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

They always seem prepared for every scenario, but not everyone in Hyrule would know that since they often work from behinds the scenes. They truly live up to their OoT nickname as ""the shadow race"" since their presence is everywhere, yet hidden from view. The towers, Divine Beasts, pillars, and many of the shrines were buried underground until activated, so how do we know for sure that all of their hidden technology is accounted for?

&amp;#x200B;

The recent BotW sequel trailer ends with Hyrule Castle seemingly rising from the ground, which at first reminded me of the [opening scene in Stargate Atlantis](https://youtu.be/3z03h5mPxHk?t=31), but of course I shrugged that off because... that would be stupid... right?

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, but let's go back to what I've brought up already: they were advanced enough to have a radar detection system, an army of robots, and massive mechanical beasts that could fire death lasers. They also had enough foresight to know that Ganon was coming not once, but twice - and they prepared well in advance each time, even going so far as to mummify themselves so they could help the hero during the second Great Calamity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is going to space really that farfetched? Maybe... but isn't it interesting that deep below Hyrule Castle there's a secret [astral observatory](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/thumb/2/29/BotW_Laboratory.png/800px-BotW_Laboratory.png?version=1cc721906c8d4697ad95e3808f480599)? Isn't it also interesting that [aliens were nearly a thing in BotW](https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/legacy-images/imagefeed/Early%20Zelda%3A%20Breath%20Of%20The%20Wild%20Concepts%20Show%20Link%20Without%20An%20Arm%2C%20Minish%20People%2C%20And%20More/aliensconcept.jpg)? And think of the significance of when Hyrule Castle is shown to be rising in the trailer. It happens immediately after Ganondorf's body awakens, as if something below the castle was reacting to his presence. Such a reaction is exactly in line with what the rest of their secret underground technology does.

&amp;#x200B;

So, maybe the Sheikah saw the 3rd Great Calamity and secretly engineered some star drives under Hyrule Castle as a last resort. I mean, if you were part of a highly technologically advanced race that could see the future, you'd also wanna find a way to get the fuck outta here when you realized Ganon is immortally angry.",48,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c0l39i,Why BOTW2 will probably display the most impressive boss fight in a zelda game so far,"I realized today that BOTW2 will most likely display an incredible fight between Link and Ganon(dorf). Indeed, when you think about it, both are at the top of their strength. (Sorry if I make mistakes, I'm french :D)

&amp;#x200B;

First, this Link is the strongest of all Zelda games, in my opinion. Let's assume that the Link of BOTW2 ""finished BOTW at 100%"". He already has 20 hearts and maxed stamina, perfectly knows Hyrule and can teleport across it, since he unlocked all the towers. He has the Master Sword, probably at its full power if he finished the trials, the hylian shield, and ancient arrows, or even the light arrows.  He can also use the sheikah slate and the four runes, as well as the four champions powers. This Link is extremely skilled with a sword, as he was chosen to protect Zelda by the king, and he is experienced: he fought lynels, yigas, the four blights and Calamity Ganon. Moreover, he is obviously extremely strong: he can climb on almost every wall, and can parry a charge of a lynel with his shield (Zeltik, check his channel if you don't know him, figured out that he have to swing his arm with a pressure of 448 000 newtons to do it, in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toC9UqVnz8g). This is insane.). Not to mention that he probably got new powers in his arm from the green energy we saw in the trailer.

Link from BOTW is insanely strong, has the best gear we can imagine, and knows Hyrule and the monsters that wander through these lands. He really is the best hero Hyrule has ever known.

&amp;#x200B;

And now, Ganondorf, or whatever this corpse is. This thing was sealed under Hyrule castle by the glowing hand (some people say that it's sheikah energy, others think it's hylia herself,  I really don't know), but he was able to summon Calamity Ganon anyway. Even imprisoned in that cave, he was able to create and control the blights, and send enough of his energy in Hyrule to take the control of the guardians and the divine beasts. Now that he's free, imagine how powerful he might be. And he's probably still kind of immortal, since he stayed sealed for a really long time without dying. 

And, if I can add a personal theory to this, I think some people sacrificed themselves to enhance Ganondorf's power. Let me explain. The shiny crystals we see everywhere in the caves in the trailer really look like the luminous stones we can found in BOTW, and we know that these stones are vessels for the souls of the dead. Moreover, I really think that the place where the corpse is, under the castle, is some kind of temple built for Ganondorf. When we see the wall of the cave in the trailer, we can see an engraving of man on a horse wielding a trident, clearly representing Ganondorf. So imagine hundreds of people, most likely gerudos, meeting in this temple built for their king, and giving their life for him, creating all these shiny stones. Aonuma said in an interview that this game would be the darker of the serie, so I wouldn't be surprised by some human sacrifices.



In the end, we have this Link, the best hero of all history, and this Ganondorf, more powerful than ever and boosted by the sacrifices of his servants. I expect their fight to be really memorable. I would be really disappointed if the final boss of BOTW2 is as easy as BOTW's one was.

truezelda,t3_c0a02t,Cadence of Hyrule first impressions,"With the release of the new Zelda themed indie game, Cadence of Hyrule, I was excited to give it a shot, even though I never played it's precursor crypt of the Necrodancer. Seeing as many people are excited yet hesitant to buy the game, i want to give my first impressions to you guys about how i feel as a newcomer to the Necrodancer series.

To begin, the game is fun, yet challenging. I have died many times in my first few hours of playing as i got accustomed to the controls and battling system. 

There is no sword attacking button, you run into enemies to attack, but like every 2d Zelda, each enemy has special attacks and defenses that you must work around. Enemy has a shield? You could either knock it down by attacking head on or go around them and hit their weak point. Honestly, if you've played 2d Zelda, this should be natural to you.

You have the option to play as link or Zelda after the tutorial and must find the other in the world to play. I chose link and i enjoyed what i played so far.

When enemies are present, your movent and attacks is locked to a constant beat that you can speed up or slow down by pressing certain tiles. Enemies also move to the beat at their own speed and direction. It is easy for them to overwhelm you at times so you must think smart and fast if you're going to survive.

The items feel like classic 2d Zelda items so the only thing you need to worry about when using them is if you press their button at the time of the song. If you don't press the button at the right time you are temporarily frozen for that beat but are quickly given freedom back right as the next beat begins. Also, you get new items quite frequently so the game feels pretty refreshed.

Some items, like the shovel and torch, are limited in use so you will have to get new ones eventually, but unlike, say weapons in botw, these items usually last long unless they are incredibly powerful like a reflect ring.

There are classic Zelda locations in the game like kakariko village and Hyrule Castle with the game taking a lot of inspiration from alttp both graphically and sound wise.

The music is amazing although in crypts it can be hard to hear which hurts since your movement is tied to it.

The story reminds me a bit of breath of the wild's with what you are collecting, but this might change as the game continues.

If you suck at the movement, you can put in a feature that makes it so you can move at any pace when enemies are present, but the enemies will only move when you move, removing the importance of the music in the gameplay.

You will die. A lot. Don't be worried though because, although death takes away items like ruppees, there's a second currency called diamonds which you can use in a shop to buy items before you come back to life like heart containers (oh yeah heart pieces are in the overworld), bombs, torches, etc. There are shops in the overworld which contain items as well to help access new areas.

I hope this brief overview of what i played of the game helps you guys decide on whether or not to buy the game.",45,public,,0

Hot takes-

1st off, the game is gorgeous, but there were noticable frame dips periodically on the overworld. Nowhere near as bad as the Korok Forest in BoTW, but still noticable.

2- NO HD Rumble. I was excited to see how they implemented this, but it seems like they've entirely abandoned the idea. It could just be for the E3 demo, but no one I asked at the booth had a definitive answer for me on the subject.

3- The Crane game is a dirty cheat. I spent a good chunk of my demo farming rupees to play this 3 separate times, but the claw machine plays much more like a real claw machine than in the GB/C version. Don't expect to get the Yoshi Doll on your first try!

4- The Shield is more useful! Sword-swinging enemies will be knocked back, giving you a chance to attack them. This is a nice change that open up for more aggressive combat than the original had.

5- NO D-Pad support! This doesn't FEEL like a big deal, until you realize that the analog stick restricts movement to the 4 cardinal directions and their diagonal counterparts. The analog control, then, feels imprecise. I mean, I could still play the game, but I hope they address this oversight.

6- I saw a Zora! I haven't finished DX this go around, and I don't recall Zora's in the game on my first time through, but sure enough there was a Zora (ALTTP style) in a pool of water very early on.

7- Stealing works the same as in the original, with the crazy death animation and all. I stole the shovel on the first try, and saw someone else do the same and re-enter and get electrocuted. Good stuff!

8- Pressing A+B simultaneously auto-skips dialogue! This is a pro-tip for speeding through everything that you already know.

I think that's it! Like I said, I only had the fifteen minutes, and I regret wasting my time on the stupid crane game. But hey, it was my only chance, and I wanted to see what all I could accomplish before my time was up.

In case anyone has any questions, I hurried through the mushroom/powder segment, and made it about halfway through the dungeon before I timed out. I didn't make it to getting Rocks Feather, but dangit, I tried!

truezelda,t3_c025f0,A few minor details about Ganondorf that I found in the trailer,"I haven't seen anyone mention this specific thing, so figured I'd post it and a couple other minor things I found.

On the wall painting with Ganondorf, it appears like he is being depicted leading an army of Gerudo.

[Bottom left and above, Gerudo on horseback with spears?](https://imgur.com/6zYaXIF)

[Bit hard to see but look at the bottom right and then above that, it looks to me like Gerudo with bows drawn](https://imgur.com/BCZhKNr)

Definitely seems like Gerudo to me because they look like they're wearing crop tops and you can see some lines of ponytail behind their head that are drawn the same way Ganondorf's hair is drawn. It's easier to see them if you go frame-by-frame in the vid.


Onto the other stuff: 

[The hand's fingernails are actually pierced into Ganondorf's chest, as malice pours out of the holes. Weird.](https://imgur.com/JQjhPL6)

[Bracelets or broken shackles? Note the matching one on his ankle.](https://imgur.com/EsDbexj)

[Ganondorf's crown is very broken and...part of it is embedded into his forehead?? What is up with that?](https://imgur.com/OvXJuLu)

[Ganondorf's raised hand- There appears to be a small hole through the palm of his hand. I thought this was a shadow or fingernail at first, but it definitely looks like a hole and it stays there while in motion.](https://imgur.com/MvpxUlr)

Also somewhat interesting to note here- I thought his painting on the wall looked like he was wearing a long wide sleeved shirt similar to his WW outfit, and if you look closely here you can indeed see a torn up long sleeve on his raised arm. Completely pointless detail but it does seem to be a callback to his WW attire.

And that's all I got. Couldn't find anything notable about Link or Zelda that people haven't already covered other than they're carrying a pack of firewood on their mount. Exciting stuff.",36,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c08yl9,"[SPOILERS] ""He has given up on reincarnation‚Ä¶"" and the Zonai Tribe","When we are in the final stage of the fight against Calamity Ganon, Zelda tells us that ""[he has given up on reincarnation"" in order to become this pure enraged form](https://youtu.be/ICDVgc9MmbU?t=146), this sequel will explain to us how he did it and I think I have most of it down.

I think the Zonai made the Calamity possible, they gave Ganondorf the hability to be at his full power and then the Sheikah eradicated the Zonai for it. Calamity is  the most successful and powerful Ganon ever, so much so, that he  wipped out most of Hyrule in little time, killed several sage-equivalent people (the champions), got a full robotic army, almost killed Link, and killed the King of Hyrule.

&amp;#x200B;

**First, the connection of the Zonai with Ganondorf**

The Zonai were a dominant, warmongering, magical weilding race, the description of their barbarian outfit describes them like: ""warlike tribe from Faron region"". Here a few reasons why the Zonai would ally with/worship Ganondorf:

1. The head where the Spring of courage resides, the patterns on the entrace of the Akkala region temple, etc. The Zonai have plenty ""serpent"" representations, which also look like a Dragon, just like the Sheikah depict Ganon on their paintings. If they see Ganondorf as a Serpent-like dragon, they would totally ally with him. [In this video this guy even says they have representations of pigs.](https://youtu.be/ucm4BEjA-Wk?t=219)
2. If they were warmongering they would *love* to ally with Ganondorf, a warmongering lord.
3. [The people behind what I think is Ganondorf](https://youtu.be/3fr1Z07AV00?t=16) in the teaser [reaaally look like people](https://i.imgur.com/TUyIKqk.png) in [aztec outfit](http://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/370575743412862978/1024/10/scaletowidth/0/0/1/1/false/true?wait=true), and also they look a bit like the barbarian armor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Second, the connection of the Zonai with the Hand**

The Zonai in almost all of their designs, [they have a spiral](https://i.imgur.com/aYhyFa7.png) which matches [the direction of the spiral the hand's scribings are making.](https://youtu.be/3fr1Z07AV00?t=20) Plus the hand if found in the cave which is filled with tons and tons of Zonai-like ruins.

Also the Hand looks like it's grabbing Ganondorf's heart, which was a sacred Aztec ritual.

&amp;#x200B;

**Third, what they wanted to do**

I have the following certainties:

1. Ganondorf went to the Zonai for an army. That's why he's seen riding with them on the wall paitings.
2. The Zonai and Ganondorf needed to go under Hyrule's Castle in order to get to the Hand's Chamber to become Calamity.

I know for sure that Ganondorf went willingly to the Hand's Chamber because his clothes look  ritualistic and doesn't look like combat armor. Furthermore [the throne is addorned with Gerudo's shield](https://youtu.be/3fr1Z07AV00?t=40), so it'd be unusual for him to be sealed or executed at a place in which his race's shield is.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fourth, the Sheikah and Hylian erradicated the Zonai**

I always wondered why there were Guardians at the bottom of the Akkala region's maze, and now I think I know why: The Sheikah erradicated the Zonai. That's why there are Shrines behind and at the end of every Zonai ruin and why there are Guardians inside of the Akkala's maze. Think about it, why would there be Sheikah tech and monks in a Zonai ruin? if not to guard the ruins in order to keep them from beeing used by evil again. Even the Barbarian set is given to you by the monks, who took it from the Zonai.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fifth, filling the blanks‚Ä¶¬†or what I think happened**

10,000 ago, the Great Plateau, which is where the original Hyrule's Castle was, was still in the North, on top of the area where the current Castle is right now.

Ganondorf being the king of evil finds out of of an acient Zonai Ritual that is capable of freeing one's spirit of the bodily burdens breaking the cycle of rebirth, making him reach some kind of ""buddhahood"" or perfect state of himself.

So he goes to the remaining Zonai for help in order to conquer Hyrule by finding the Hand, releasing him of his cyclical existence and becoming full hatred. He discovers the Hand's Temple was build below Hyrule's Castle long long time ago, so long and so deep underground that not even the original Zelda and Link knew or saw it.

He and the Zonai gather an army and invade Hyrule's Castle, but to their surprise, Ganondorf focuses on one thing: He summons powerful magic and rises all of Hyrule's Castle land and moves it, so the Great Plateau is created, the Castle and the Town are now in ruins.

He enters the Temple of the Hand and his army defends the entrance while they start the ritual. The Hero and the Princess breach in, and go  to seal Ganondorf but it's too late, he's insulated into the Temple. There's nothing left to do but to wait for Ganondorf to come back.

The remaining Hylian and Sheikahn army chase the Zonai and find they are a warmongering race that worships Ganondorf. They start developing the new Sheikah tech in order to defeat him for good.

A few years pass, the Guardians are all set, the Pillars surrounding the void that left the Great Plateau are being built.

They notice some kind of smoke being released from the Temple. This dark pinkish smoke is toxic and/or creating monsters‚Ä¶¬†Must be Ganondorf's essence. So they build the secret chamber (on which we fight Calamity Ganon) to contain it.

Calamity Ganon rises, the Sheikah army is all set, and they completely anihilate him. Then they seal the temple and the secret chamber, and on top of it, they begin constructing the new Hyrule Castle, thinking the next time Ganon rises, they Pillars will be enought to contain him. The drawings we see in the teaser are made by the Sheikah warning us of how this all happened.

Ganon remains there, creating a form of his evil essence that will render Sheikah tech useless, called Malice‚Ä¶¬†It takes him 10,000 years to do so.

truezelda,t3_c0gr83,Zelda? Or nah?,"Should we have a Zelda game that flips the script and allows gameplay with Zelda? Couldn‚Äôt care less so long as the story is well done. I play for the story, which is why I‚Äôm probably not going to play Cadence and didn‚Äôt play Warriors. Canon and timeline all the way. 

If developers get the idea, or the whiff of an idea, that the game could be a bit awkward by shoehorning Zelda playability into the mix, I hope the scrap the idea. 

Part of the allure of Zelda for me is that you can kind of place yourself in the shoes of the main character. To put this into an example, imagine not being freaked out by the Silent Realm in SS because you‚Äôre too far removed from the situation and viewing it only through a strategic lens. To view a Zelda game in solely this was would be to cheapen it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am a weirdo that loved(s) the OoT Water Temple and luxuriates in a difficult puzzle, but if that‚Äôs all this game is, you‚Äôre missing so much and should probably just play chess (Which is also fun! High school teacher and chess club advisor here!)

But switching between characters can easily break this experiential spell, the fourth wall, and I would hate to see these main characters used as tools instead of experiencing the game and story from one POV.  

All said, I don‚Äôt mind if they decide to have a couple playable characters, but it‚Äôs a tight, tight rope to walk to get it right.",0,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c01mtr,Breath of the Underground - My hopes for BOTW2,"Aonuma said that we will be exploring the same Hyrule again, but I dont think it'll be the same. I think that instead, the entire game will take place underground.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a scene in the trailer where the malice shoots up. If you notice, when the malice hits the ceiling it splits into four different directions. I believe that just like BOTW, there will be four main dungeons.

But where are these dungeons? Well, it could be cool if we learn that during one of Calamity Ganon's attacks (100 years ago, 10,000 years ago, or even earlier), many of the surface tribes (including the Zonai) retreated underground and began brand new civilizations in Hyrule's depths. You'd see dudes just walking around and what not, just like on the surface.

What role Ganondorf will play is anyone's guess. But either he will escape to Hyrule and revive, or remain a corpse and haunt you throughout your journey, similar to how the blood moon appears in BOTW. I hope that he has a very involved role.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, here are my hopes for BOTW2:

\-Playable Link AND Zelda

\-Open world with some segmented caverns/pathways

\-Four main dungeons. Actual dungeons, with map, keys, puzzles etc.

\-120 Shrines, including four major ones with similar mechanics to the divine beasts.

\-Aside from Subterranean Hylians, different races that live underground: The Kokiri, the Deku, the Zonai, the Minish, the high tech Sheikah, the Subrosians, Yetis, Mogma....or brand new ones.  
\-New runes.

\-New weapons with added durability, plus an upgrade and repair system. Like Gondo's Scrap Shop in Skyward Sword.

\-New gear

\-New Giant Bosses, like Gohmas, Moldorms, Dodongos, Manhandlas, etc.  
\-Ancient structures from past Zelda games buried over time.

truezelda,t3_c0h8an,I Don't Think Link's Design in the LA Remake is Very Good or Fitting for the Type of Game Link's Awakening is.,"At first I hated the art style pretty broadly, but now I actually like some of it. The enemies and environments actually look really cool, especially the moblins.

However, I feel that i won't be able to enjoy the game because I dislike this portrayal of Link so much. One thing I am really sick of in these 2D games is Link sounding like he's six years old. Link is 17 in Link's awakening, he shouldn't sound like he's in fifth grade. What's the point of making a 17 year old sound like he's a child when he isn't? High pitched squeals are annoying and I'm sick of them in Zelda and it seems like Nintendo really wants to push them more and more. Skyward Sword Link was 17 years old as well, but he doesn't sound like a baby. It just is grating and I wish Nintendo would stop doing, especially in cases where link is actually a late teen and not a child.

Next, I just hate his design, and the design of the other humans in this game. Yes, I understand that it looks semi-similar to how Link looked in the gameboy version, but the Gameoy version looked that way because that art style was the best way to make a clear and decent-looking game on the technical limitations of the gameboy.

Many people point to the snapshots you get in the game as sort of an indicator of how the game is meant to look, but it really isn't. Those are optional side-quest type photos used made explicitly to be comedic and wacky. This is what the actual Link's awakening concept art looked like https://imgur.com/gallery/EZJL4.

So to see Link as this beady-eyed stumpy figure just kinda ruins it for me. I don't like his design, and I don't think it fits the game. Link's awakening is a lighthearted game, but it also has serious moments. There are moments of gravitas, and moments of tension, andmoments of erriness where you are supposed to take it seriously.
Christmas Specials aren't that way. Christmas animated Specials are
meant to be seen as lighthearted throughout. It's going to be difficult for me to get the same feeling playing this game while I'm a controlling a character that's meant to be so comical and lighthearted.

The limitations of the DX version made it so Link could be cutesybut also taken seriously. When I fought nightmare at the end, it really seemed like a climcatic battle you were meant to take seriously. In this remake I can't imagine it will feel the same way, because the character you control is always going to look like a character that was designed to be cute, comical, childish, and not meant to be taken seriously above all else.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I just really think this was the wrong direction to go with this game, and while it's not everything, the protagonist's design is going to be something you see throughout the game. I wish they had taken another direction when designing link for this remake.",0,public,,0

What do you guys think we'll end up with? Or hope we'll end up with?

 I personally hope we get a bit of both, where we can travel around the northern half of hyrule from the first game, and then a neighboring region above hyrule with new and crazier areas. This way we can get a more lived in hyrule like a rebuilt castle town, and still have plenty of new areas. This concept could also work with going East to explore the sea more, etc. I just really hope we get to see at least a bit of hyrule being rebuilt to feel like our progress in the first game actually led to something impactful.",1,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c030me,"(Theory) the undead gerudo in the trailer of the botw sequel is Ganondorf, kept alive by the sheikah."," In Skyward Sword, Demise laid a curse on Zelda and Link:

‚ÄúThose  like you‚Ä¶ Those who share the blood of the goddess and the spirit of  the hero‚Ä¶ They are eternally bound to this curse. An incarnation of my  hatred shall ever follow your kind, dooming them to wander a  blood-soaked sea of darkness for all time!

I  think that the undead beneath the castle IS the gerudo king ganondorf,  being kept alive by Sheikah technology to try and stop the chain of  incarnation of ganon. Maybe the only way of making sure that ganondorf  won't be able to ressurect or incarnate is to keep him alive, and maybe  because of his imprisonment he let go of his humanity and became  calamity ganon. This body was his shell of humanity he let go in the  events of breath of the wild.

Calamity  Ganon seems to have no soul, no emotions, no memories. There's nothing  left of what became the King of Gerudo called Ganondorf. This way, Ganon  bypasses the traditional ressurection and instead became a ghost of his  former self. Only filled with the hatred of Demise.

This  theory would explain the 10.000 years of peace and technology because  of ganondorf imprisoned and kept alive, which he gave up on 100 years  prior to breath of the wild.

""To know  Calamity Ganon's true form, one must know the story from an age long  past. The demon king was born into this kingdom, but his transformation  into Malice created the horror you see now. Stories of Ganon were passed  from generation to generation in the form of legends and fairy tales.  But there was also...a prophecy. ""The signs of a resurrection of  Calamity Ganon are clear. And the power to oppose it lies dormant  beneath the ground."""" ‚Äî¬†King Rhoam¬†(Breath of the Wild)

In  Breath of the Wild we thought the power to oppose calamity ganon were  the shrines popping out of the ground, but what if the real power was  beneath the cellars of the castle, where a barely alive ganondorf was  being held. Killing him would resume the chain of incarnation, but  remove the immediate threat of Calamity Ganon.",6,public,,0
truezelda,t3_c0039x,"Get ready, BotW2 may be an emotional roller coaster","I think I'm still in a bit of shock after watching that teaser, and still trying to process what we saw. But a few thoughts are coming together, and I'm getting really excited.

A criticism I had for BotW was for the lack of major shifts in the over-world. OoT had the destruction of the market, ALttP it's dark world, TP it's blanket of twilight. These games took the worlds we grew to love and hit it with a destructive reality, and I missed that impact in BotW. Sure it's post-apocalyptic, but the destruction was mostly forgotten; the beauty of the world was made to be peacefully appreciated.

Well now lets take a look at the situation we're heading for. Most of us have poured hundreds of hours into exploring BotW's Hyrule, climbing mountains to check out vistas, sneaking through fields to catch horses, intimately learning every river bend, where to find each gaurdian. We know and love this map very well by now..

Unless we interpreted incorrectly, Aonuma stated he wants to revisit this Hyrule in BotW2. Of course there has to be a major change to the world.. He also stated it's going to get even darker than MM... I feel like this sequel is going to be what the adult portion of OoT was to BotW. I think the ground is going to open up, Hyrule's going to crumble and we're going to watch it happen.

It's all speculation, they could go the dark world route, which'd be awesome. But hey, we all said we wish we got to play during the destruction 100 years ago. And if they're listening, destruction Nintendo will give :)",6,public,,0

You could argue the overworld was practically the real main character of BotW. It's what the game was all about. In stark contrast, most of the teaser happens underground, with a glimpse of Hyrule at the end, and I wonder what this means:

1. No overworld? Will this be a dungeon crawler of sorts, a sort of 180 back to the extremely closed off linearity of SS? God I hope not. I really don't want BotW's freedom to be a one-off thing that gets totally ditched in its direct sequel. Also, I really didn't like BotW's cutscenes. To me, a linear, heavily plot/cutscene-based game would be a massive shame.
2. We're still open world, in the same place, but totally revamped. While it would be a bit of a shame to have the same geography, it would be feasible to change things about enough to keep things fresh. There could be a neat sideplot about rebuilding the kingdom, perhaps.    Maybe they'll combine the open overworld with a huge underground mega dungeon as a better alternative to the shrine system?

Anyway, the Japanese publisher has put the most available information on their site here (with a Google translation): https://www.reddit.com/r/necrodancer/comments/bzq0jt/cadence_of_hyrules_website_has_been_updated_with/

So the villain is named Octavian, the name of the bard that became the Necrodancer when he found the Golden Lute in Crypt of the Necrodancer. Problem is, he's dead without the power of the Lute, which in Cadence's world has been destroyed for two years. So Hyrule has its own lute, and possibly it's own Octavian (though Cadence's necrodancer was shoved into a hole never to be seen or discussed again, so he could have fallen into Hyrule, dead).

What twists this is the appearance of Octavian. He was always bald and bearded both as the bard and the necrodancer. Here, he has... Vaati's emo hair from Minish Cap, but yellow eyes and a decidedly non-emo grin.  What I'm fixed on, though, is his bowtie: it's a red eye, the bows are like wings, and his lapel is notched to also look like the eye's wings.

 My theory is that CoH actually fits in the Zelda timeline, and some fragment of Vaati possessed Octavian, and this is part of or before Vaati's terror between the Minish Cap and Four Swords. What would be really cool is if Vaati, a wind mage, somehow had a connection to the Wind Waker; he's holding a baton (and dressed as a conductor) in the promo art

I'm convinced that what we were shown was Ganon, or at least some kind of Ganon-like figure, rather than Yuga as was suggested.

[First shot](https://imgur.com/Il1vgFP). The hand seems to be coming from something like the Sheikah essence distillation points (You don't really see it here, but later on when the Malice energy swoops up towards it). Based on what we see in the trailer, I think that this has been holding him for a very long time, but has started to dissipate, leaving only the hand behind now...we see it fail at the very end of the trailer.

Link and Zelda likely went down here to investigate this, and came down just in time to see it unwoven.

[Second shot](https://imgur.com/Dfy65sg). You've already noticed the Gerudo symbol on the fabric, but I'm wondering if the bracelets were actually meant to be shackles of some sort - notice the chains coming off.

[Close shot of the hand](https://imgur.com/HzlTw9z). I'm not convinced that it's Sheikah, the style reminds me more of the Zonai.

truezelda,t3_bzgqrp,My preemptive theory about Ganondorf in the sequel to Breath of the Wild.,"My tentative impression on this is that the hand seen in the trailer is indeed suppressing his power (i.e. essentially sealing him away), but what I find most interesting is that this entire spectacle fairly reminds me of Skyward Sword.

Just for the sake of comparison, Gaepora recites the legend concerning the Great Apocalypse: ""When the light of the Goddess sword shines bright, the Great Apocalypse will awaken from it's long slumber, but do not fear, for a youth GUIDED BY MY HAND shall reveal himself in a place most sacred."" Of course though the events that unfold pertaining to this legend are exclusive to Skyward Sword and has no bearing on this, but ""guided by my hand"" with regards to this image yields some ideas and paints a good picture, even if meant figuratively.

I know that it's entirely too early to get a definite idea of what's going on, but my preemptive stance on what we see here is the tangible aftermath of an event preceding 10,000 years ago (Calamity Ganon's sealing by the backstory depiction of the Hero and the Princess). Here the truth behind Ganon's perpetuated revival, as it relates to BoTW's own continuity (not that of the series as a whole, given that the game illustrates a backstory revolving around Link, Zelda, Ganon that has not been explored, which is something that hasn't happened in the series until BoTW, meaning that any number of these repeated attacks pre-BoTW could have happened without existing games exploring them), is witnessed.

It is stated in Master Works/Creating a Champion that the colossal incorporeal anomaly that hovers around Hyrule Castle in the image of Ganon, is but a mere powerful manifestation of his malice that took the shape of his image without actually identifying itself as the physical source of his existence. This would imply that the Ganon Link faces, who attempted to recreate a body for itself, is an absurdly powerful offshoot (a bunshin even? a.k.a soul-split/copy) that simply bypassed the source seal and garnered enough power by way of Sheikah technology, to recreate a body in initiating in what is essentially a pseudo return of Ganondorf. This is slightly reminiscent of Ganon bypassing the seal on the Dark World as Agahnim that went on to cause mayhem in Hyrule, but nothing of this scale here.

If this is true, then Ganondorf is displaying a prodigious amount of power not seen in any Zelda game to date up until this one. It further begs the question of how powerful he truly is when he transforms into the ""real"" Ganon, and how long ago did the probable events of this sealing that gave way to the concentrated flurry of mere offshoots attacking Hyrule through the ages, as well as what was needed for it to be carried out.",26,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bzhtif,The music in Breath of the Wild sequel trailer is a reference to Link to the Past,"Hey everyone, I haven't seen anyone bring this up yet. Pardon if it's already been spotted.

truezelda,t3_bzkij8,Theories on the Floating Castle,"I'm curious to know your theories about what's happening with Hyrule Castle and what it means for the potential setting of the game.





I'll post my theory.

If you got to 0:55 of the trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fr1Z07AV00), you can see the castle erupt in a cloud of smoke and sink down slightly. It looks almost as if it gets disconnected from its supporting structures. Then, it becomes still for a few seconds and the smoke settles. The castle then starts rumbling and pushing smoke outwards as it starts to rise in the air. The castle isn't levitating with some sort of magic- an immense force is thrusting down to push the castle upwards, almost like its a spacecraft.




If you look back to BotW and remember the 5 pillars surrounding the castle when Calamity Ganon has taken over, it looks rather similar to the supports used to hold a spacecraft while it is launched (https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/43428680310_41e08a1655_k.jpg). Hyrule Castle is also surrounded by a moat (https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/the-legend-of-zelda-hd/1/16/Castle_MAP.png?width=640), which indicates that the Castle may have been built to be disconnectable from its inception. Some people theorize that the castle is rising to reveal an underground world that Zelda falls into, but I don't think this is the case given that the moat surrounds the Castle and would likely fill such a hole with water. 





Although the other shots in the trailer are hard to decipher because they are likely out of order, I think that Link (and possibly Zelda) is going to be in the castle when it rises. We see shots of the ground fall beneath Zelda's feet, Link grabbing Zelda's hand when she is below him, and the green hand grabbing Link. The green hand is probably pulling Link and Zelda into the castle because they are the only people who can stop Ganon and he will escape if they don't follow him.





Whether Hyrule Castle is just going to float in the air above Hyrule, become Skyloft, fly to a new land, or go to outer space is impossible to tell, but I think at the very least that Link will be in the castle when it rises up. Hopefully Zelda gets to come along too.",3,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bzj0i9,BotW sequel theory: Ganondorf‚Äôs body,"So my theory is like so:

Link and Zelda find this temple where Ganondorf‚Äôs body remains. In BotW we are told he renounced his physical form and his capacity to be reborn in order to become Calamity Ganon (but they never said he indeed destroyed his physical form in the process), so this is what they found, the temple where Ganondorf more than 10,000 years ago gave up his body and created the Malice. The temple is a Zonai temple, they designed the ritual and the Hand, this isn‚Äôt Sheikah tech, this is a magic ritual.

I think the Zonai helped Ganondorf because he looks a lot like the armor they created (the barbarian armor), maybe it‚Äôs some kind of Cort√©s-Quetzalcoatl-Mayan thing where they mistook him as their god, or maybe he‚Äôs always been their god, so they helped him. Then it backfired and they died because of him, or it would be awesome if they got turned into Lizalfos and Bokoblins.

Maybe he gave up his body *after* (and not before) battling the Sheikah guardians for the first time and this is how he created his plan to beat the Sheikah tech with Malice. Maybe this is his own after-battle Chamber of Resurrection of some sorts.

His body armor looks a mixture of a Zonai‚Äôs priest, with maybe Yiga rings.

Now that they found him, they are going to accidentally revert the ritual and restore Ganondorf and the cicle once more.",4,public,,0

IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO BE WRONG",223,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bztc47,Disappointment in Direction of Zelda Series (And Nintendo as a Whole),"With the most recent Zelda announcement (and other announcements), it seems to have been confirmed for me that Nintendo is headed down a, in my opinion, worse direction for their games (and console), though since this is a Zelda sub and I am a big Zelda fan, and it was Zelda that was the final nail for me, I'll be focusing on Zelda. Though I will cover Nintendo briefly at the end.

Up until around SS, there was a really abundant amount of original Zeldas released, with minimal remakes and a handful of ports.

But starting with OoT 3D, there grew an increasing amount of full-on remakes. OoT, MM, TWW, &amp; TP all received increasingly unnecessary remakes, with increasing laziness in each one. And now, LA, a game already easily available for the 3DS &amp; one of the most revered 2D games, is getting a very unnecessary remake, before we even get a new top-down Zelda for the Switch.

\---------------

Meanwhile, on the main game front, there's been this increased delve into open-world.

Now, I can appreciate an open world to explore, but with games in general there's been this explosion and obsession with everything being open world &amp; increasing in size, and its gotten tiresome. All open worlds end up feeling very same-y to me, with the experience feeling muddied with very little iconic or memorable moments, and the game burning me out partway through, leaving the ending feeling unsatisfying and more of a relief that its over than enjoyment.

I don't get the idea that more open = better, and linearity = bad.

There are benefits to open worlds, but there's also significant downsides, so as with anything, the ideal would probably be a good balance between extremes. Like a linear structure with some optional open-ness to explore. But instead, we get an imbalance of free exploration at the cost of puzzle structure and decent story.

\---------------

First, there was ALBW. I enjoyed it, it was neat being able to do dungeons in different orders. But it came at the cost of progression in difficulty, and puzzle depth, since they don't know if you're supposed to have which items at each dungeon.

Then came BotW, an all-in delve into open-world, with them pushing the idea that you could go anywhere at anytime and do any shrine in any order and do any dungeon in any order, even the final one. 

This was supposed to be this huge mind-blowing idea, but really, it just led to a more bland, less memorable experience.

\---------------

Because you could go anywhere in any order and do anything in any order, there was no story structure, thus no overarching narrative, and thus no character progression. The mini-stories they had in each of the 4 regions were almost non-existent. The characters that weren't paper-thin caricatures (the Champions) were mostly unmemorable. The story is really non-existent, uninteresting, and not compelling since you figure out the entire thing after the tutorial. The lore is so thin it may as well not even exist. There was a past Ganon attack where nothing interesting happened, the Divine Beast/Sheikah tech were made, and the Yiga were born. And people keep mentioning the Zonai as if BotW's crew even remembers what that is. They just threw in some ruins to find and gave a name to the tribe, they have no culture or history. That's really it, there's not much to find out or learn about, so a paper-thin lore combined with a paper-thin story leads to pretty uninteresting worldbuilding. Yet this is the world they decide to continue with, of all the ones.

Plus, the Yiga were made for a pretty dumb, poorly thought out reason. The Sheikah made tech that the Hylians like &amp; use so the Hylians get scared of the Sheikah and then ostracize them? Why? So then some Sheikah decide to worship the devil? Why!? It would've made a lot more sense if the Yiga were made after an event like the Sheikah getting betrayed and wiped out by the Hylians after they had them do the dirty work, as in OoT's backstory. That is a much harsher betrayal and gives a much better incentive for the Sheikah to despise the Hylians so deeply they'd do anything to destroy them. But that would've required more than 2 brain cells put into the plot and lore. And even if they had a better creation, they're used terribly, barely affecting the plot and being taken out like a joke. They could be removed entirely and the plot wouldn't change.

There was no overarching lore.

There were little to no memorable moments because the game designers couldn't craft any memorable moments, since you could go anywhere at any time. For example, there's a neat canyon leading into the desert, with structures built into the canyon walls, and characters telling you about the desert. But I was idly exploring for towers or shrines from somewhere else, and just kind of stumbled into the desert from the mountains and found my way to the town and bazaar. It didn't feel fun or magical finding this place, I felt like I missed a lot not being introduced into the area. That's how I felt most of the time I found a town. Like I missed a few scenes setting stuff up. Everything is just a lame stumbling upon with no build up or proper introduction.

And much like with ALBW, this approach to being able to do any dungeon/shrine in any order harms the ability to build progressive puzzles. Since any shrine could be someone's first, any puzzle trick has to be enclosed within that shrine; it has to be introduced and expanded upon within that shrine, but not carry over to another shrine without introducing it again. Thus, there's no proper progression of puzzles that build upon each other, because shrines are all enclosed puzzle boxes.

Also, there was a lack of music, which is a pretty crucial element to Zelda. It's soundtrack is very recognizable, and music is even used in the gameplay a lot, yet BotW had a distinct lack of music, with the great trailer song not even being in the game.

\---------------

Then there's BotW's narrow gameplay loop, with everything falling into either a melee weapon, arrow, or slate power.

I can appreciate a laser-focused gameplay loop, but it would work a lot better for a much smaller-scale game since it wouldn't overstay its welcome and wouldn't fatigue its users with its limited uses.

The wide open world meant for large exploration over a long period of time clashes with the very small-scope, narrow gameplay loop, making the game extremely repetitive.

This, combined with the very small amount of enemy variety (2 baby enemies, 3 standard enemies, &amp; 4 mini-bosses from my memory), causes every enemy encampment encounter to feel very samey, with later encounters being no different from early encounters. Which causes the entire game experience to feel very samey and then blend together, which isn't helped by there being only 4 unique slate powers. This is even across vastly different environments, since they all share the same limited pool of enemies, with the only difference being elemental swaps. Making each environment further feel same-y, which the game-breaking stamina already does.

Plus, this narrow gameplay loop stripped down everything else that made Zelda unique &amp; different; most notably, the various items. 

Zelda usually has a handful of unique and fun items that Link collects along his way, increasing his moveset as he progresses and allowing him to solve puzzles in ways he couldn't before. However, with the focus on having 0 progression stoppers, items were stripped and replaced with 4 slate powers and the mechanic of elemental weapons.

This limited the way in which you can solve puzzles, as well as limiting the ways in which puzzles could be created and the variety of puzzles.

This also made the world exploration feel very same-y, as you didn't gain new ways to traverse the environment. You didn't gain a clawshot, double clawshot, grappling hook, whip, ladder, Zora Flippers/Armor, Iron Boots to sink or stick to magnets or tank high winds, Hover Boots, Pegasus Boots, barrier magic, invisibility, Eye of Truth, etc. So every new place you explore, you explore in a very similar way. Which again, isn't helped by stamina being completely broken, letting you climb anything with no trouble, removing a lot of the potential challenge of exploration.

Also, they stripped away the various unique mechanics and button prompts you would normally get throughout a game, like for minigames or small interactions or just various item/mechanic use. For example, the fishing village has nothing unique to do; you can't fish with a rod, you can't get a canoe like in TP, and you can't sail a boat. The only thing you can do is swing a leaf awkwardly into the sail, which is just jumping onto a platform &amp; awkwardly swinging your weapon while awkwardly repositioning yourself. This led to an area with a unique look feel like every other town. There's no Sumo Wrestling with Gorons. There's no Underwater Diving with Zoras. There's no flapping or grappling with Rito. There's no riding a Kargarok or Loftwing. There's no canoeing down a rushing river or through a tranquil pond.

\---------------

And don't get me wrong, I did enjoy BotW to an extent. The gameplay itself can be fun. Climbing is fun, and I like that different slope angles drain your stamina differently. But it is extremely unbalanced, and breaks any attempt they could make at making the world a traversable puzzle. I like the idea of cooking, but its very poorly implemented. Food is broken, letting you instantly heal to full health at any point in time. Buffs are rudimentary and unbalanced. Armor bonuses are unbalanced and kill a need for elemental food buffs. I think the weapon durability/using weapons as disposables was fun, but I wouldn't want it to return or be the mainstay. I found combat simplistic and it got boring quickly, especially coming off of the dual directional/timing focus of SS. But overall, BotW was a decent enough experience for a twist on Zelda with neat ideas and some fun to be found despite its critical flaws.

But BotW strips away so much that makes Zelda unique, while adding so many features that makes Zelda like every other open-world on the market. I can't go anywhere else to get another experience like Zelda, but I can find plenty of other similar same-y feeling open-world games, so why would I want Zelda to become like everything else? And why do so many people want Zelda to become like everything else? But BotW was popular, and the new Nintendo seems to be chasing trends and is thus making a BotW 2.

\---------------

Now, I spent all that time talking about my criticisms for BotW because the Switch was a big hit, and BotW being one of 4 launch titles and a Zelda title, BotW was a big hit. So its a lot of people's first Zelda, they like it, yada yada. But its so different, and lacks so much of what many others enjoy about Zelda. They don't even use the green suit! At first that didn't bug me, when it was just another experimental title, but now it is probably going to be the basis for the next era of Zelda. This influx of new fans may cause Nintendo to completely change the core of Zelda, as well as many more minor elements that make up Zelda, and for me that's pretty sad, as BotW is the most generic-feeling Zelda. 

Them using it as a turning point for the series now has me concerned that I won't be able to see what I love about Zelda again for awhile. But the new people want more BotW because many don't even particularly like normal Zelda, and Nintendo is riding its popularity, so likely that in addition to Nintendo's direction of an overabundance of remakes (and ports for other games), we're going to be getting obnoxiously directionless open-world games with thin narratives, no lore, no good depth of items, and game-breaking survival elements for awhile. BotW 2 is definitely using the same engine, so it most likely will have most of the core problems. It may even bleed over to top-down again. So, who knows when we get another conventional Zelda game.

Speaking of, BotW 2 seems to be featuring this old hidden gem of a villain, Ganondorf, despite facing Ganon in the directly previous game. Usually, direct sequels are much more experimental, and thus are very fun and exciting and can be some of the most memorable Zelda experiences. MM is, in my opinion, the best Zelda story, being very character driven and having a lot going on in the background. Link explores strange new worlds, and fights unique, one-of-a-kind villains with stories &amp; lore that are all introduced and tied up in one neat package. It's refreshing to break up the constant stream of Ganon.

But instead, since BotW was popular, and people want Ganondorf, and Nintendo seems to be chasing trends more, we get a mummy Ganondorf for a direct sequel to a game where you defeated a force of nature Ganon. Which is a disappointment both for the loss of experimental story &amp; lore &amp; world potential, but also for the already bad lore of BotW. Calamity Ganon is retroactively made less terrifying since instead of it being Ganon who became so corrupted and demonic he became a literal cloud of demonic energy, its that he seems to still have a human form and was just projecting his demonic energy. 

Now, you may be thinking I'm overthinking it and overreacting since we don't know almost anything about BotW2, but I think I know enough. BotW was an entry point for many people, who don't care about prior Zelda, and the next game they announce within an incredibly short amount of time is BotW 2. This being a bit of a new Nintendo, it's highly likely it'll be very similar.

Sure, we know almost nothing about BotW aside from ReDorf, and they could make an amazing story, but coming off of BotW's paper thin characters and story, overall bad OG lore and lack of connections to existing lore, I am quite skeptical that a soon-after sequel is going to be so much better in any of those areas. Similarly with gameplay, it being in the same engine and seemingly coming soon makes me skeptical they will fix the glaring issues of BotW; notably, cooking/food, basic combat, 0 puzzle progression, and lack of items. I could see them adding more Runes, or the Arm being used as various magical items, but even if stamina is balanced and armor buffs are balanced and eating is balanced, it will still feel like a typical open world game missing the unique elements of Zelda. I doubt we will see a return of traditional-style items, or a good balance of linearity and exploration, or a return of good lore in big 3D Zeldas for awhile. For comparison, Sunshine came out in 2002, and Odyssey in 2017, so it took 15 years to make a similar-styled 3D Adventure Mario game. And even then, the more linear ones in between were still really good and distinctly Mario, whereas open world games like BotW tend to be more generic and drag on.

\---------------

Then there's the highly requested but terrible idea of Zelda Maker, being tested in LA HD with rudimentary Z1-style tiles.

I assume they're testing it to see if it might work, which I hope it doesn't, because even with simple Z1 tiles, people are still going to make really shit dungeons. As Mario Maker has shown, the majority of people are really bad at level design, and it is much harder to make a competent Zelda dungeon than a Mario level, especially in the vein of conventional 2D Zelda with themes and items and complex puzzles that build upon each other and utilize the environment, like ice, quicksand, falling tiles, floor tiers, etc. And I hope it doesn't pan out because I don't want a Zelda Maker to replace 2D Zelda the way Mario Maker is seemingly replacing 2D Mario, considering they've only ported a 2D Mario to the Switch but are making a full-on Mario Maker 2.

\---------------

In a vacuum, I enjoyed BotW decently enough. But definitely not enough for it to be the direction nor basis for the future of the Zelda series. I enjoyed it as an experimental departure/twist on Zelda, as they had done for MM, TWW, &amp; SS. But I didn't think every game after MM should have a 3-day cycle, or think every game after TWW should be a sailing pirate game. And I think BotW has way bigger critical flaws than any of those, and that kind of style would quickly overstay its welcome if repeated in subsequent games.

But, Nintendo seems to be changing. I don't know what the main cause is, I assume the loss &amp; replacement of Iwata.

In general, Nintendo is making their hardware much more cheaply, and seem to be downgrading their quality compared to the previous gen. The switch and its parts being made from much lower quality materials than their previous stuff. Yet they are charging Joy-cons for $80, despite individual joycons being pretty much half-controllers except for minimalist games. The dock is pretty crap and could've been so much more than a glorified charger &amp; HDMI port, and it even scratches Switch screens. There's Joycon drifting. Dead screen pixels. Extremely shitty Switch stand. No headphones for online voice since the only headphone jack is on the Switch, which doesn't work for docked mode. Dualscreen &amp; usable Touchscreen are gone, with Switch not being able to utilize its inferior touchscreen due to games needing to work for both docked and portable. But having a dedicated screenshot button is important because the other consoles have it.

Their software is getting much more minimalistic, with features previously common being removed. Virtual Console is gone, replaced by an inferior system. Online is replaced by that same inferior system. Miiverse is gone, removing ways to talk about the game and in-game. The home screen is much more bland, with no styles and little to do. Many mainline games don't have save files, like BotW, Odyssey, Crafted World, Let's Go, etc., with the only way to have another save file being to make a new Profile. Why would they remove something as basic as multiple save files?

Nintendo seems to be moving away from doing whatever they want &amp; think is fun &amp; innovative &amp; towards following trends and mob appeal and min-maxing their profits, as well as a general decline in quality. Making tons of remakes &amp; ports instead of new entries in those series. The above-described shift in Zelda. FE devolving into weaker LN trash-tier stories &amp; awful writing &amp; waifu bait. The newer Pokemon not even having every mon available to transfer, recently announcing you may never again be able to catch em all in a mainline game, and constantly replacing gimmicks with inferior ones (Mega &gt; Z Moves &gt; Dynamax &gt; Alolan forms). No new top-down mario with new powerups, but instead a ton of crap levels to look forward to. Many games launching with much less content than prior entries.

All of which, to me, shows a shift in Nintendo that affects both their hardware and games; whereas before they always seemed to have a nice, high quality feel to both their games and hardware, this move towards minimalism in both the software and hardware, as well as the chasing of trends at the cost of the unique feel/appeal of the franchises, is making them seem more like every other company, and losing the appeal of their games to me. It makes me think the stereotype of Nintendo quality and family-feel is going to fade away.

And I'm not saying they were perfect before, but I think it would've been better for them to be where they were and improve upon their weaknesses (marketing, online) than pull a sharp turn and lose what made them special.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I wanted to share my feelings as I'm not sure when Zelda will return to form, so it's a bit saddening realizing that things are changing, for the worse in my opinion. I recognize not everyone will feel the same as I do, but I wished to express how I felt and perhaps find solace in the camaraderie of like-minded people, and to know I'm not alone.",0,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bzm00r,My Theory for Breath of the Wild 2,"*So I'm not super savvy on everything that happens in the timelines, but I'm just piecing what I know together so this theory of mine can make sense, okay? Also, there will be some re-telling of the story so people know I'm not just making up the story of BotW, I've played it. Oh, and I feel like the last bit works as some dialogue, if you don't like the dialogue, apologies, but it's just how I imagine they would talk.*   


**In Breath of the Wild, Impa mentions that Calamity Ganon has been around for 10,000 years, so specifically they know about Calamity Ganon, not any other version. So here is my thought process on this:**    


Ganondorf, leader of the Gerudo 10,000+ years ago, waging war on Hyrule, with allies like the Rito, Goron and Zora to provide them aid. This is before Calamity Ganon is even mentioned, but Impa's ancestors possess knowledge of the past with the Hero, the Princess who possesses the birthright of Light, and the Evil One. They know the triumphs and failures of the past - one defeated by the hero (*Legend of Link timeline*), one sealed away in Twilight but eventually destroyed by the Hero (*Twilight Princess timeline*) and one ultimately destroyed before destruction can occur (*Wind Waker timeline*). In the end, the Evil One eventually returns.

  
So to try and prevent history from repeating itself again, the Sheikah used their magic to seal the  Gerudo King (*Breath of the Wild version*) underground in a special tomb. To ensure the safety of the castle and the kingdom, the Sheikah place 120 different shrines around Hyrule to strengthen the magic spell holding Ganon underground, while also holding an alternate use, to train the Hero of Legend. The reason Ganon looks all shriveled and similar to the monks in those shrines is he was placed under the same sort of magic, but with more restrictions since he was a prisoner.   


The King of Hyrule back then agreed to keep the large scale project off the record so nobody would have knowledge of it until the 'Hero meant to destroy the darkness' arrived. Also, since their king mysteriously vanished, the Gerudo surrender and become a part of Hyrule's allies.    


Meanwhile, sealed underground, Ganon's hatred swells and turns into a stronger form of magic --- **MALICE**. He cannot move, but his magic manifests a shade stronger than anyone has ever seen. His first appearance and defeat are recorded as such, which Impa tells Link in Breath of the Wild. When ""*the princess wielding the birthright power*' defeats the Calamity Ganon, the power is seeped back into the tomb that it was borne, slowly regaining strength... for months, years, even decades.  


**\[Skip if you know Breath of the Wild's story\]**  
Fast forward thousands of years to the time of Breath of the Wild's Zelda and Link.  The Kingdom has concerns about the re-emergence of Calamity Ganon. They bring out the Guardians and the Divine Beasts that the Sheikah have created. However, Link and the other Champions are also brought forth to fight the oncoming Calamity and pilot the Divine Beasts. They ultimately fail as Calamity Ganon's power has influenced the machines and killed the other Champions.     


Fast forward another 100 years, Zelda is still fighting Calamity Ganon alone. Her will unwavering but her strength is finally slowly fading. Link has awoken from his 100 year slumber and takes on the task of saving Hyrule once again. He defeats the Divine Beasts and frees their pilots' spirits. He storms Hyrule Castle, with Master Sword in hand, and defeats the Calamity Ganon. His grotesque and grisly mechanized, malice-corrupted form. As the battle rages on, Calamity Ganon takes on a new form, one of a mighty malice boar full of rage and hate. Mindless and reckless, it charges Link as he rides on his steed, but ultimately fails it's goal to slay him as he riddles it's body's weak points with arrows of light. The eerie glowing orange and yellow eye of the great boar beast blinks one last time, before it rolls back into it's head and the body turns into a mist of dust.   
    
Link has taken on the 120 various puzzles and challenges inside the trials, as well as the Ballad of the Champion, laid down by the wise Sheikah Monk, Maz Koshia. In place, he had all of the shrines tied to the magic that binds Ganon to his prison in the underground below Hyrule Castle. So with all of the trials completed, and Calamity Ganon defeated, the Hero's true test was about to begin.   


**\[Random embellishment and fan service\]**

Unbeknownst to anyone else, a telepathic link was forged between the Master Sword and the Sheikah Slate, so after the closing credits of Breath of the Wild, Link and Zelda can hear a voice coming from the Sheikah Slate, along with words on the tablet.   


*""Master Link, I am the spirit of the Master Sword, called Fi. Several thousand years ago, when I was forged, I also served another master who had bravery of your caliber. I believe you have what it takes to defeat Ganon again.""*  


Zelda retracts from observing, exclaiming  ""But we have already defeated Ganon! Link has already slain him.""    


*""I'm afraid not, Princess Zelda. That was merely a presence of the power that Ganon truly commands. The real Ganon lies below.""*     


""Below!?"" Zelda asks inquisitively, ""Below where?""    


*""Below Hyrule Castle. You possess the Sheikah Slate, you can open the way.""*     


***Fi inside the Sheikah Slate proceeds to explain to the two how the Sheikah sealed away Ganon, and how Calamity Ganon came to be afterwards, and how the Sheikah trials were additional bindings to hold back his power.***    


*""So you see Master, the Sheikah were testing you, and you passed. There is a 95% probability that you will succeed. I wish you luck Master.""*    


The slate goes silent as Zelda, clearly frustrated, walks away slowly, trying to process what she was just told. Link looks down and sees his sword glow a solid blue. He knows what he has to do. As he walks towards the castle, Sheikah Slate in hand, Zelda stops him in his tracks.     


""I'm coming too.""   


I believe that this will be the final use for the Sheikah Slate, it will open some hidden passageway that leads to Ganon's prison, but Link will probably receive some other power, based on the use of his hands in the trailer. It's way too early to know for sure, but I am super excited.

I ran the interview through Google Translate and you can read the results below. Since it's Google Translate the translation into English isn't perfect, but you should be able to get the gist of it. I've put in () the proper translation of certain things, and added one comment in italics. 

Here's the translated interview:

This time at 4Gamer, CEO Ryan Clark of Brace Yourself Games who developed this work at the venue of the indie game ""BitSummit 7 Spirits"" held in Kyoto and Miyako Matsuri on June 1st and June 2nd. Interview with Mr. Oliver Trujillo , lead designer and programmer, and Toshihisa Nikaido of Spike Chunsoft . I was able to listen to the story of the collaboration and the game system of this work in a short time. 

4Gamer: Thank you very much for today. Immediately, please tell us what led to the creation of the ""Cadence of Hailar (Hyrule)"".

Mr. Toshihisa Nikaido: Originally when the project was initially launched, it was talked about whether it would be possible to collaborate with ""The Legend of Zelda"" as download content for ""Necro dancer"". When I took that plan to Mr. Nintendo (LOL) and talked, the story became louder and louder, and finally it was ""Would this be formed as a single independent game?"" 

4Gamer: What did you feel when the story swelled and it was decided to make a ""Cadence of Hyal (Hyrule)""? 

Oliver Trujillo: Of course I was very excited! I thought it would be wonderful to be able to collaborate with the ‚ÄúThe Legend of Zelda‚Äù series, which I have been playing since I was a child. However, on the other hand, because it is a collaboration with a series with a history lasting more than 30 years with many fans, there was also anxiety. We do our best to meet the expectations of both ""Necro Dancer"" and ""The Legend of Zelda"" fans. 

4Gamer: Did you have any special requests from Nintendo to create a collaboration title? 

Mr. Trujillo: The expression and setting of ""triforce"" was very carefully supervised. It was strongly said that I want you to protect the setting and mysterious part of the series as it was before, even in this work. We continue to be at the center of the 'crypto of necro dancer' setting. 

*In other words, Nintendo cared about the lore.*

4Gamer: According to the ‚ÄúCrypto of Necro Dancer‚Äù setting, the main character, Cadence, had a curse on his heart, so he had to act according to the beat, but he moved to the link and Zelda as well. Is there a reason to do it? 

Mr. Nikaido: I'm sorry. Please wait for the follow up on the story. 

4Gamer: The graphics have been completely revamped from the previous work, and the visuals of Cadence are also new. 

Trujillo: Yes. The art group also worked very hard and took quite some time to produce. This dot painting is of course not only beautiful but is made so that the tiles of the character and the background can be clearly distinguished, and it is finished in such a way as to bring about a good effect in game play.

Mr. Ryan Clark: ""The Necro Dancer"" had only one graphic player, but this time it has been produced by four people. The previous work was only one with the dot picture of the character facing the front, but this work prepares the pattern of four directions. Of course, the quality of the dot picture itself is increasing, but the number of pictures has increased in this way. 

4Gamer: Speaking of the Necro Dancer, music is one of the great charms, but how many songs will be arranged and appear in the ‚ÄúThe Legend of Zelda‚Äù series? 

Trujillo: I can't mention a specific number, but I can tell you that there are many songs available anyway. Various songs will appear from the whole series, centering on the ""tribes of the gods (Triforce of the Gods is the Japanese name for ALTTP)"". 

4Gamer: ""The Legend of Zelda"" is also attractive for music, so I think that the arrangement has got a crazy feeling. 

Trujillo: Yes. The composer is also a large Zelda fan, and all songs are arranged with great effort. In addition to dungeons, there are fields in this film (game), but in each of these places, various songs in the series are arranged in a Necro dancer style.

4Gamer: By the way, which two do you like best in the ""The Legend of Zelda"" series? 

Trujillo: I like the Tribe of the Gods (Triforce of the Gods/ALTTP) most. The first time I played was the NES (Famicom) version of the first ""The Legend of Zelda"", but ""The Tribes of the Gods (Triforce of the Gods/ALTTP)"" was much wider in the world than the first. Furthermore, when I first entered the ""world of darkness"", I was surprised to hear, ""This world is still wide!"" 

Mr. Clark: I have two, and I love the ""link adventure (AoL)"" in the old title . I really liked the action that started with the bottom strike. I love ""Breath of the Wild"" in recent titles . The scope of the search was so wide that I could play very fun. 

4Gamer: It's very clear that everyone in the team likes ""The Legend of Zelda"". Well, there was a story that this work has elements to explore not only dungeons but also fields, but please tell us where it changed from ""necro dancer"" in the game system besides that. 

Clark: The basis of the game system that moves to the rhythm is the same as the previous one, but I think the game play feel will change considerably. For example, this work introduces the concept of elevation difference to the terrain, and you can use it to fight.

Mr. Trujillo: Also, ""The Legend of Zelda"" is one of the features that comes from ""mystery solving (I'm guessing this means puzzle solving)"" everywhere, but this work also introduces elements to solve mysteries and puzzles. It is designed to enjoy ""how to go to that point"" while looking at the weapons, items and surrounding environment on hand. 

4Gamer: Speaking of ""The Legend of Zelda,"" I'm looking forward to it, as mystery solving (puzzle solving) is one big attraction. The PVs (trailer) published on the official site include a scene where the link shoots and a cut where Zelda uses ""Neel's (Nayru's) Love"" or ""Din's Flame"" like the ""Super scuffle (?) smash Brothers"" series. did. Does the action of the two mean that it is made in reference to the whole series and related works? 

Trujillo: That 's right. Each character action is made with reference to the related titles as well as the entire series. Since Zelda has never been a playable character in the series, he has referred to actions such as the Super Smash Bros. 

Mr. Clark: In terms of action, I choose something that looks interesting in the play of moving to the beat of the ""necro dancer"". I think that each action appeared in the form of getting on the system of the Necro dancer well, so I hope you can look forward to what form it will appear in.

4Gamer: I see. Another thing I was interested in seeing the PV (trailer) was that it was a PV (trailer) for Japan with the voice of Cadence and a narration in Japanese. I think that there was no Japanese voice in the previous work, but is there a plan for Japanese voice to be included in this work? 

Mr. Nikaido: This time, I'm also making efforts to the Japanese version. I hope you will have a follow-up. 

4Gamer: I'm looking forward to it. Time has come soon, so please leave a message for the fans at the end. 

Trujillo: We've always wanted to show you this game, and we're so excited to play it, so we're happy to finally release it. This work mixes well with the clever game system that Necro dancer fans like and the search (exploration?) elements that Zelda fans like. We hope you will enjoy it as both fans will surely enjoy it. 

Clark: I'm very honored to collaborate with Zelda 's legend to make this work. It would be great to see the fun that we felt as we created the game through gameplay. 

4Gamer: Thank you very much today.",45,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bxiwpn,A Link to the Past... boring?,"So recently I‚Äôve been on a mission to buy and play all of The Legend of Zelda games on their original hardware in no particular order. 
Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild were a blast (of course), even though I did sympathize with those who missed the great soundtrack and story lines we get in other games while playing BOTW.

truezelda,t3_bwrt77,An interesting view on how Ganondorf would be a good partner for the next big Zelda installment,"My fianc√© pointed out that some of the Links have descendants, and not ALL of them are heroes. There‚Äôs a significant time gap between the hero of time and the hero of twilight, so of course the HoT has offspring that weren‚Äôt heroes, correct? So in the thousands of years the Gerudo must have had *SOME* men being born as King and not turn evil.

So nonchalantly I just said, ‚Äúwell yeah I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù But she asked ‚ÄúWhat if Link and Ganondorf grew up and trained together, and they were always trying to one up one another but they were close like brothers. However, because of history everybody turns a blind eye on Ganondorf and spites him due to legend and past history. 

So this would make an interesting story, playing as Link and Ganondorf to come together to fight off some sort of evil (a return of Vaati, or even something like Cia would be a nice return). Aonuma-San did say he wanted to incorporate multiplayer in the next big Zelda game if he can. And I think, honestly, Ganondorf as a gerudo voe, would make a great story within a story to break that, ‚ÄúCursed rumor‚Äù for lack of a better term. 

Links story could stay the same, pull the sword, slay the evil. Or maybe have some sort of storyline where Hyrule was in utter ruins and a hero *never* arrived and now this ‚ÄúLink‚Äù also has to prove people wrong that he‚Äôs not going to be the same as the last time. 

Not something totally serious but I think all-in-all a good Ganondorf partner traveling with Link  trying to break the curse would be awesome. 

Source of my fianc√©‚Äôs inspiration on the idea [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxidgVphteP/?igshid=1wxwltjntgl3s)

Edit: you guys are taking this WAY outta context. I understand that it‚Äôs the ‚Äúcool‚Äù thing to do to correct every little knit picky wrong thing, but chill. I know every gerudo male isn‚Äôt Ganondorf and not every Link descendants is ‚ÄúLink‚Äù. This was all loosely written lol. Just elaborate on the idea not the little knit picks please, let‚Äôs focus lol",156,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bwfpzy,Shrines in BOTW: thoughts and improvements,"A very common complaint about Breath of the Wild is that there aren't many dungeons in the game, but what if I told you that the sections of the overworld were indeed dungeons, just not very satisfying ones?

The way that the overworld works is in fact very similar to a normal dungeon. Whenever you enter a new area your first instinct is to find a tower to get a map, just like a dungeon. Same thing with the shrines themselves, all of them need to be found, but you need to explore the area first, sometimes you need to even solve certain terrain puzzles if you even think about getting to the shrine, but some of these shrines have you complete quests to unlock them, these quests behave very similarly to keys used to unlock rooms in dungeons. All of these shrines give you at least three rewards: a spirit orb, a chest (containing a gemstone, rupee, or a weapon) and a greater understanding of how to use the physics in the game to your advantage.

I think what a lot of people's problems with the shrines is just how they don't pay off in the end. You get spirit orbs to get stronger, but what purpose does that serve if there aren't any bosses to use any new techniques on? The lynels are tough, but they're the only tough enemy to fight in the game, and once you've fought one of these beasts you've fought them all. It's honestly kinda just boils down to mindless attacking. You can get so much food and powerful armor, so it leaves you with little to no challenge if you're half decent at the controls. If there had been more enemy varieties in the overworld or a boss shrine that unlocks once you beat all of the shrines in that specific area, a lot more people probably would have felt more comfortable with the dungeons. But the lack of a payoff would probably be due to the fact that you could do these shrines in any order you wanted to, this eliminates the entire point of dungeons. It wasn't about the lack of puzzles, it was the lack of feeling lost. In a traditional Zelda dungeon when you find a key or an item your first thought is how do I use this? You start to mentally backtrack while thinking about the ways you could use that item, you might try EVERYTHING you could think of, however once you do find the solution you feel unstoppable! The rest of the dungeon comes together, the last few puzzles feel like a whirlwind and once you come out on top nothing can stop you!!! This is, sadly, where Breath of the Wild falls short, because each shrine is practically handed to you, without any real effort being required to go forward. And the fact that each shrine is seperate from one another makes it feel less like a dungeon, but more like a checklist that you slowly check off. One. Short. Effortless. Shrine. At. A. Time. This isn't the only route Nintendo could've gone down with this design, in fact I have a few ideas to help them improve the shrine design.

1. Each region should have an overarching theme for each set of shrines. I'm not talking about the setting. I'm talking about the skills the player should be learning and improving in each shrine. (Example: stamina management, accuracy, food management, etc.) This would help in giving the player a goal to reach. Whenever I finish a dungeon in a Zelda game, I should leave feeling like I accomplished something big, I should be better than I was before I ventured inward.

2. The shrines should feel more connected in order to give the player a greater sense of progression. I feel like there's a very easy solution to this problem, and that would require some requirements to unlock certain shrines (example: the player would require a certain main item (hookshot, boomerang, deku leaf, etc.) In order to progress in the shrine) or maybe the more difficult shrines would require emblems (similar to emblems in the dlc shrines) in order to unlock them, with this we could still keep the convenience of the bite sized puzzles while it still feels like a dungeon.

3. But each dungeon requires a boss to fight at the end of it. So we should make a bigger shrine in each region that would unlock after you find and complete the rest of the shrines in each region. It would be composed of more complex versions of puzzles that the player previously encountered and it would have a boss fight at the end as well. This boss should be a sort of test of whatever skill the player learned in each shrine.

4. The end reward should be something related to the trials you endured to get there in the first place, like a skill or ability. For example, if I finished my set of shrines that were related to elemental resistance, I should get a reward like 10% resistance to elemental attacks against the player. This would be an amazing reward because not only am I stronger than I was before, but I can also use this ability to make my experiences in Hyrule much more enjoyable.

And that's pretty much all I have to say about shrines and how they could've been improved in Breath of the Wild. 

I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions to give the shrines a much needed makeover!

TL;DR: shrines are regular Zelda dungeons (minus the bosses, and the lack of connectivity) Nintendo should've given the dungeons a specific area in the game that players could improve in (stamina management, accuracy, etc.) There should be boss shrines at the end of each set in order to give the player one last satisfying test. And they should give a reward that feels more satisfying to collect than a spirit orb at the end of it all (an ability similar to the Champions abilities, or a skill like 20% boost to attack)",81,public,,0

In level 7, the Eagles Tower, I was carrying the iron ball in the room in the top-right corner of the second floor, and I tried to throw the ball over a barrier at the bottom part of the screen. The ball bounced off the bottom of the screen, and landed directly on top of the barrier, keeping me from picking it back up. I can't reset the dungeon by leaving, and I stupidly saved after it happened, keeping me from solving it by resetting my console.

truezelda,t3_bv1njo,What sets Zelda puzzles apart from/above those in other action/adventure/RPG games?,"This is yet another thing that I have been wondering. People, fans and casual players alike, readily accept puzzles as being one of the primary focuses of a Zelda game alongside exploration and combat. People will also accept that Zelda isn't an environmental puzzle game like Portal, The Witness, or Talos Principle.

But other non-puzzle games have puzzles too, yet people only accept them as little obstacles to break up the primary gameplay. God of War has puzzles, but the game is about killing Greek/Norse monsters in combo-heavy and brutal ways. Early Resident Evil has puzzles, but it's about conserving precious ammo and running from mutant abominations that jump you. Pok√©mon has puzzles, but it's about encountering new creatures, capturing them, and fighting with them. Final Fantasy has puzzles, but it's about progressing a story, building a crew and ending up fighting some godlike being in the end.

But Zelda is ""about"" solving puzzles as much as it is about exploring and fighting if not moreso. Even for the ""exploration crowd"", people within that vocal group wouldn't want to neglect the puzzle element or replace it.

Why is this? I honestly don't know. Is there more focus on environmental interaction in Zelda than those other games? Are the puzzles better in some way than those other games?",98,public,,0

truezelda,t3_btgi1v,"Hard modes in Zelda - good, bad, necessary?","What do makes a Hard/Hero mode good in Zelda, and should these modes continue to be included? 

Hard modes in Zelda seem to appear in two flavors, broadly speaking. There's the Second Quest, like in the first game and OoT's Master Mode, where the overworld is either scrambled or reversed, and more importantly, the dungeons are completely redone to be harder - new puzzles, stronger enemies, and more unorthodox puzzle solutions. 

Then there's the Hero Mode, which tends to have Link taking double damage, with hearts generally not appearing in the overworld, forcing the player to use bottle items to heal. I would say BotW's hard mode, despite being different in details from the others, falls more into this category than the other. 

Ultimately the main difference between the categories is which aspect of Zelda they emphasize/make more difficult - the puzzles or the combat. Second Quests increase the puzzle difficulty, Hero Modes increase the combat difficulty. 

I think it goes without saying that Second Quests take a lot more effort on the developer's part, as creating entirely new puzzles is much more labor intensive than flipping a switch to increase Link's damage. Personally, in theory, I prefer the idea of Second Quests - combat has never been a focus of Zelda games to me, and I think that the combat in most games with Hero Modes remains pretty easy anyways. However, the implementation of Second Quests leaves a little to be desired. The original NES Second Quest is honestly pretty bullshit in some parts. I can at least beat OoT Master Mode without a guide, which is much more than I can say about NES Second Quest, but it also gets flack for nonsensical puzzles and being too obscure. 

As far as Hero Modes go, I'd say the best implementation of this has been in BotW. I think that's controversial - a lot of people believe that the enemy stat inflation is stupid, and in a vacuum I would agree. However, I think that making you fight enemies that are way too strong for you in the beginning of the game, coupled with the weapon durability system, teaches the player to fight in unorthodox ways. The best weapon in the beginning of a BotW hard mode playthrough is undoubtedly the Korok's Leaf - blowing enemies to their death is much easier than fighting them. Soon, you become strong enough that the increased enemy defense doesn't matter. Regenerating health is also controversial, but I think it serves a purpose too - it forces the player to be offensive, attacking repeatedly and precisely to not waste weapon durability, and it encourages you to learn the enemy attacks so you can counter each one correctly with a flurry rush. The best example of this would have to be the Calamity Ganon fight, which I think is actually a great fight on hard mode. His health bar is so big and regenerates so fast that if you don't counter each move correctly, you lose progress in the fight. People complain that the regeneration turns fights into boring slogs, which can be true, but I think it doesn't happen if you maximize your opportunities to attack. The increased enemy strength also encourages exploration, as you go off to find the powerful weapons they've newly hidden to compensate. 

Other hero modes are pretty boring, I feel, because they don't change anything about how you play. Wind Waker and Twilight Princess are pretty easy games; doubling the damage forces you to be more careful, but I honestly didn't feel much of an impact. A Link Between Worlds is a bit harder to me, but it still wasn't much of a change. As I said, combat isn't a big part of those games to me - they excel in dungeon design, so it would have been cool to see that part of the games switched up. I think the freedom of combat and exploration in BotW makes it a better candidate for a simple battle difficulty increase. 

But honestly, as much of a longshot (heh) as I knew it was, I was hoping BotW's hard mode would be a true Master Mode, with reworked shrines/dungeons. I actually liked the shrine and dungeon setups in the game, and I liked how the puzzles creatively relied on one powerset the whole way through, but on the whole they were just too easy. (I think the second wave of DLC helped, but that's an unrelated topic.) 

Ultimately my stance is that Second Quests, where the puzzles are changed, are usually more fun and fulfilling, but they are less likely to occur and could be handled better by the series. If the combat of the series continues to improve as it did with BotW, then I think that Hero Modes could be really fulfilling in the future. Personally, I think Zelda can be more fun when it's more difficult, but I know that a lot of people don't care about the difficulty for Zelda games, which is why I think having multiple modes can be good. I myself still haven't beaten Adventure of Link because I get bored of just not being good enough to progress. But at the same time, having just one difficulty level probably leads to more precise balancing on the part of the developers, and a more precise vision. So if the hard modes aren't going to change much, they might as well not be there. 

What are your thoughts - should the modes continue to appear, and if so what kind of hard mode should they be? Or, do you disagree with my opinion on any of the hard modes that have already appeared?

**TL;DR** : Some hard modes in Zelda change puzzle difficulty, some change combat difficulty. Which is better, and which ones do you like/dislike? (also a bit of a tangent on defending botw's hard mode)",60,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bt69lh,"Link to the Past's Dungeon Design, and the future of Zelda","So, recently i made a post discussing why i didn't like the dungeon design of link to the past. 

To put it simple, alttp features dungeons that are based mostly on combat with simple puzzles in the rooms and gimmicks with varying quality based on the dungeon (ice floors, standing on slow floating platforms in the dark, etc) and bosses that also range in quality (moldorm pushing link off stage, mothula's bullet hell on conveyors, etc)

Though this, I've seen many people defend this dungeon design, preferring it over the pre-breath of the wild styles of Zelda dungeons, which are mostly based on item based puzzles. One major reason i see these people saying this is because it didn't feel nearly as fulfilling completing these types of dungeons compared to those in a link to the past.

So, with the almost universal panning of breath of the wild's dungeons, which dungeon type would you like the next Zelda game to take, a ""puzzle box"" like dungeon from more modern games or a more combat focused one like the first couple of Zelda games?",89,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bsw99a,How do you feel about stories in Zelda games?,"Most Nintendo franchises have barely any story, so the thing I've always loved about Zelda in particular is how the games are generally more narrative focused. They spend more time trying to develop the characters, the lore, and the setting, ever since a Link to the Past. But this seems to be controversial in the fanbase, with many people seeing the story as nuisance, stopping them from doing what they want. Of course I don't feel that way, but what do you think about stories in Zelda games.

truezelda,t3_bsriph,Twilight Princess Back in Time Glitches,"I was recently watching back an AGDQ video on Zelda Twilight Princess (GC Version), and I wanted to try out some of the glitches that was shown in the video for myself to learn how they are done. This particular Back in Time Glitch is the one you could perform early in the game and a little later on at the Forest Temple as shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/mHwUanGnrJc?t=1752) to perform a clip through BiT glitch, however I'm getting a completely different result as what's been shown, I manage to do the glitch, but when I go to load the game save file, I get nothing, I don't get the Bobokoblin fight, and instead get blank screen, and I really do not know why that is, when it should be loading the game file, doesn't seem to matter which save slot file I load it always has a blank screen after selecting it.

Any ideas why this could be? There's no way for it to be done wrong when selecting save file from the menu screen being done at the right time, since there's a large number of frames that it allows you to perform it easily, which is something like 3-4 frames.

This glitch in particular is suppose to be able to let you load the Bokoblin fight, do a soft-reset with X + Start + B buttons together after Skipping the cutscene after it loads up, then load your save file, and the Bokoblin fight writes/saves a value of 1 to the game which is the same as the number of Monkeys needed for the Forest Temple to save time and skip rescuing all the monkeys to get across the bridge early to get the Gale Boomerang.",27,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bsd4py,A different take on a water dungeon,"Hey everyone,

So I‚Äôm a PhD candidate studying life in extreme habitats, hydrothermal vents, subglacial, etc, and while I was avoiding homework I had an idea for a water dungeon that would be interesting (I think)

Instead of manipulating the physics of water through water levels and currents, what if a dungeon revolves around the concept of different types of life growing at different pH and temperature. So you manipulate the chemistry of the water in a dungeon.

The way I envision this, you have a dungeon inside a large volcanic island or a hydrothermal vent system of some sort (like Loki‚Äôs castles but bigger). The water can be 3 different temperatures and 3 different pH and through some mechanism you‚Äôre able to alter these properties in different parts of the dungeon. The kicker would be, that certain organisms only thrive in given pH and temperature ranges. So you go to a room that‚Äôs completely barren, move a lever or blow up a wall somewhere else, come back, and the pH and temp of the room has changed and suddenly its burst to life, potentially opening new paths and blocking others.

What do you guys think, good idea or too much like science class?",182,public,,0

I got a ton of answers and some good discussion got going, which was exactly what I hoped to generate with that post.

It also occurred to me after the fact that I could tally up all the times people mentioned a game as their favourite or their least favourite, to see how well liked / not liked each game was.

Some people distinguished between 3D favourites and 2D favourites in their answers; in those cases I counted each mentioned game as a favourite or a least favourite. Some people mentioned multiple favourites or least favourites without distinguishing between 3D and 2D games; in thoses cases, I counted all the favourites or least favourites that were tied for #1, and didn't count 2nd favourites or 2nd least-favourites or etc. I also didn't count mentions of things like the CDI games or the Game and Watch games.

I have no background or education in statistics or anything, so there might be something wrong with my counting methods or the conclusions I draw or w/e. Just thought some of y'all might have some interest in these numbers. I know I was surprised by a couple of the tallies.

So without further ado, here are the numbers!

I wasn't super surprised at which games ended up having the most favourites; they're all generally well-regarded games in the franchise, and many are considered classics. BotW being the most favourites was a little bit of a surprise I suppose, but it also got a pretty high number of least-favourites, comparatively speaking, so I think it's fair to call that game ""controversial"" or ""divisive"" rather than actually disliked.

But oh boy did some of the least-favourited games surprise me. I wasn't too surprised to see Phantom Hourglass at the top of the least-favourited list, as I rarely see people talk about that game positively, but I was *shocked* that so many people disliked SS enough to call it their least favourite. Most of the time when I see the game brought up around this sub, it's because people are praising it for the things it did well rather than discussing the things it did poorly. After that the number of least-favourites per game drop off pretty dramatically; BotW is the third most least-favourited and has a high number of least favourites *relatively-speaking* (as only two games have more least-favourites than it), but still has a high number of favourites compared to least-favourites. The same is true of TP; it has a high number of least-favourites relatively-speaking, but still has significantly more favourites than least favourites.

Anyway like I said this could all mean nothing - I have no background or education in statistics or anything, so this could all actually be meaningless.

**TL;DR** It seems like this sub quite likes all the 3D games except SS (with BotW and WW a cut above the rest), and *really* doesn't like SS (much to my surprise) or PH. TP and BotW also have a fair number of people who don't like them (relatively speaking), and perhaps are more accurately described as ""divisive"" than ""well liked"".",53,public,,0

truezelda,t3_brv4a4,Breath Of The Wild is an outstanding foundation. I hope Nintendo will utilize it (correctly).,"Breath Of The Wild is an unbelievably good achievement. The graphics, artstyle the physics, the engine and how it can deliver a real open world without borders. The physics, how the elements interact each other, how link moves and plays. It is a great playground. 

Yet I was very disappointed with the game. I could argue because I really prefer the game formula which I felt in love with while playing OoT or MM but mainly because there is such a lack of content and story. It feels like Nintendo was able to build this awesome foundation but there wasn't enough budget and time to fill it with actual content. And not every mechanic was really thoughout.

I hope the next Zelda game will utilize this foundation correctly and bringing back some of the old staples the series was known for. Here are some things I would like to see:

* More focus on items again and enemies which are designed for them.
* A real storyline again. Maybe with some weirdness like Majoras Mask
* No clear differentials between main quest and sidequest.
* No to-do-lists which feel like work
* No statistics, no numbers
* More focus on different environments which feel and play different.
* Return of Dungeons (and maybe a Dungeon which utilizes Epona and/or is in the world map).
* More focus on characters and music again.
* Making revisiting familiar places worthwhile and enjoyable.
* Making the terrain more interesting again because you can't traverse everything by just using the glider or the climbing mechanics which trivializes everything.

BS Zelda - More Zelda gameplay is fun, but it's still stuck with limited 4-directional movement and lacks the silly characters that AST had. Gave us an excellent tileset for Zelda Classic though.

Nintendo Land: The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest - the game that proved that multiplayer Zelda could be done, and could be done well. Nintendo, next time you try to make Four Swords, just make it Battle Quest but without Mii's, and force the archer to be Zelda.

Soul Calibur II - SC is one of the best fighting game series I've ever had the pleasure of playing. This one lets you play as Link with a thinly veiled excuse for a 'story' that sees him going through a portal to reach Earth. He also has some OP moves with excellent ring out potential.

Freshly Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland - I want to like this game. It almost dares to be a continuation of the Great Sea sometime after TWW, it has a Great Deku Tree who just hates humans; and has other excellent characters. Guessing how many rupees people want is awful, the combat is atrocious, the difficulty ramps up way too high in the endgame, and the game relies on tedious grinding. It's worth watching a Let's Play for the ridiculous story though.

Hyrule Warriors - Gameplay is little more than mashing combos until you find a boss, at which point you evade its attack and counter for massive damage. It's kind of fun to play as so many different characters, but the story is seriously lacking. On the plus side, it has some hilarious weapon sets and gave is Linkle who is just hilarious.

Link's Crossbow Training - it's an okay on-rails shooter, I guess. 

Zelda's Adventure - It's pretty bad. The dungeons are an absolute mess. Most of them are a straight line. The cheesy cutscenes are worth watching on Youtube.

Link: The Faces of Evil - Not even the Youtube Poop material can save this dumpster fire.

truezelda,t3_brhr2f,"[BoTW]: Complete Freedom of Choice, EXCEPT...","Hey! Listen! I‚Äôm not here to make another BoTW argument thread, but here are my thoughts upon completing the ‚Äòmain quest‚Äô:

It was the best of times...it was the worst of times...this famous line summarizes my mixed emotions for BoTW. I love the game for the same reasons as all the fans and I hate it for the same reasons as all the haters. I have accepted that this is a different Zelda game than I am used to playing and I have had a lot of fun with it, but the point where this game completely disappointed me was during what is arguably the most important moment in any game. *The Final Blow*.

Throughout the game we are given *complete* freedom of choice to go anywhere, at any time we choose. We can challenge the Divine Beasts in any order we decide or even avoid challenging them altogether. Fighting whichever enemies we like along the way with all the creative techniques we can imagine. Until the very end(or very beginning) when you decide to challenge Ganon.

&gt;!As Ganon transformed into Dark Beast Ganon I knew this must be his final form. I dodged his attacks on horseback weakening him with the Bow of Light until he was crippled and the final ‚Äòeye target‚Äô appeared. I spurred my horse towards him, jumped off and opened my glider, riding the updraft from the flames in the grass. Soaring high above the beast I flew towards the eye and instinctively drew the Master Sword in a risk-everything downward strike to smite Ganon once and for all. Only I did not smite him...instead I bounced off an invisible force field half a meter above his face and was awkwardly pushed to the ground in front of him. ‚ÄòI must have misaligned the attack.‚Äô I thought to myself, and attempted the strike again. Upon the second or third failed attempt I realized the game was *forcing* me to kill Ganon with **one specific weapon**, the Bow of Light. This is completely contradictory to *everything* the game stands for. We players should have the freedom to deal the final blow to Ganon with a *Korok Leaf* if we so choose. The inability to defeat Ganon with **The Sword That Seals The Darkness** is inexcusable in my mind.!&lt;

BoTW abandoned the classic LoZ mechanics that fans like myself have grown to adore and associate with the series in an attempt to give players a new experience of freedom akin to the very first LoZ, and then totally contradicted itself in my aforementioned situation.  In what should be one of the most significant moments in every video game, the final blow, this was by far the most disappointing moment in BoTW for me. Second only to ‚ÄòThe Great Anti-Climax of Drawing the Master Sword.‚Äô 

IGN put OoT‚Äôs drawing the Master Sword at the **No.1 Position!** of their Top 100 Most Memorable Moments in Video Game History. Hopefully there is something incredible I haven‚Äôt discovered yet in BoTW, otherwise I can‚Äôt think of a single moment truly worth of this list.

To summarize: I did love playing BoTW for everything that it was, but in the future I can‚Äôt really see myself returning to this game.  Many, if not all, of the mechanics the game adopted I am able to experience in other games. With the complete lack of LoZ mechanics that I associate with the series, BoTW didn‚Äôt satisfy my ‚ÄòZelda Craving‚Äô and when I get this craving in the future I know I will be returning to Ocarina of Time, A Link Between Worlds, or Okami. (Yes, that‚Äôs right, a game not even part of the LoZ franchise dared to copy the beloved mechanics LoZ invented and it satisfies the ‚ÄòZelda Craving‚Äô masterfully in a way BoTW can never dream of.)

BoTW discarded the LoZ mechanics that the series invented and replaced them with mechanics we can find in countless other video games. I hope with all my heart that the upcoming Zelda release will utilize everything that makes BoTW a great game while also returning to the elements that the LoZ series created and perfected so well that almost no other game dared copy them. I know you can accomplish this Nintendo, and when you do you will finally create a game that will steal the throne of my All-Time Favourite Game from OoT and Okami in one glorious *final blow*.

EDIT: I was aware of the Light Arrows in previous games and the Silver Arrows in the original LoZ before I made this post. This doesn‚Äôt affect my opinion that if they *really* wanted to *force* you to use the Bow of Light they should have inhibited you from using other weapons in a more creative and appropriate way than invisible barriers. Besides BoTW‚Äôs claim to fame isn‚Äôt exactly adhering to people‚Äôs expectations based on previous games, even if it does try to replicate the original.

truezelda,t3_bre3yy,Future Zelda: THE GREAT CITY OF HYRULE,"**A Fresh Take on Hyrule**

Every Zelda game takes place in a region that is mostly wilderness. But for a future title, I would love for most of the game to take place in a singular city. ‚ÄúThe Great City of Hyrule‚Äù, or simply ‚ÄúHyrule City‚Äù would be like TP‚Äôs Castle Town x1000. The map would be about 50% the size of Breath of the Wild, and separated into 7 districts that are filled with things to do. It would have NPCs that react to weather conditions, time of day AND day of week (holy day sees the temples filled). NPCs would be abundant‚Ä¶mostly Hylians with a few visiting Gorons, Zoras and Gerudos that can be seen along the way. It would essentially be Zelda‚Äôs version of King‚Äôs Landing from Game of Thrones.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a way to give a fresh take on Hyrule without having to reuse the same locations. Kakariko, Faron Woods, Gerudo Desert, Zora‚Äôs Domain, etc can all take a break. Death Mountain and Hebra/Snowpeak can be seen in the distance, but cannot be explored. The only recurring locations would be Lake Hylia and Hyrule Castle, so other than those two, it‚Äôll feel like a completely new Hyrule.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the city would be based on Medieval architecture, but some areas would be based on Ancient Greek, Steampunk, Japanese, Southeast Asian (Indian/Khmer), and Persian architecture as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Locations**

It would extremely detailed with an extraordinary amount of places to visit. Pretty much every building can be entered:

&gt;Houses  
&gt;  
&gt;Shops  
&gt;  
&gt;Markets  
&gt;  
&gt;Taverns  
&gt;  
&gt;Cafes  
&gt;  
&gt;Theatres  
&gt;  
&gt;Night clubs!  
&gt;  
&gt;Inns  
&gt;  
&gt;Boutiques  
&gt;  
&gt;Laboratories  
&gt;  
&gt;Shrines  
&gt;  
&gt;Temples  
&gt;  
&gt;A harbor  
&gt;  
&gt;Hyrule Castle (obviously, which will be the biggest it‚Äôs ever been, almost the size of BOTW‚Äôs Great Hyrule Forest! Not a dungeon, but acts like a district that can be freely explored.)  
&gt;  
&gt;And more‚Ä¶

To take a break from city life, a good amount of the city would have quiet natural areas that can be explored:

&gt;Forests  
&gt;  
&gt;Parks  
&gt;  
&gt;Hillsides  
&gt;  
&gt;Waterfalls  
&gt;  
&gt;Ponds (Fairy Ponds too)  
&gt;  
&gt;Lake Hylia  
&gt;  
&gt;Tropical Beach

&amp;#x200B;

**Dungeons**

The game‚Äôs 100 Shrines would be underground labyrinths that actually connect. The game‚Äôs 11 dungeons will have elemental variety, and can be completed in any order (except King‚Äôs Sanctuary):

&gt;THE THREE CRESTS (To obtain the Master Sword):  
&gt;  
&gt;Courage: The Great Citadel (Where the Knights of Hyrule are based)  
&gt;  
&gt;Wisdom: The Royal Study (Library in Hyrule Castle)  
&gt;  
&gt;Power: The Gerudo Embassy (Residence of the Gerudo ambassador Agaat. Contains a hidden underground shrine to the Goddess of the Sand).  
&gt;  
&gt;\-  
&gt;  
&gt;AWAKEN THE HYLIAN SAGES (To enter the King's Sanctuary):  
&gt;  
&gt;Light: Temple of Light  
&gt;  
&gt;Forest: Sacred Garden (Hidden in Hyrule Castle)  
&gt;  
&gt;Fire: Alphon‚Äôs Foundry (Link‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs factory with molten metal)  
&gt;  
&gt;Wind: Stone Gate Temple (preserved ruins of the early Hylians)  
&gt;  
&gt;Water: Hyrule Waterworks (underground aqueduct)  
&gt;  
&gt;Sand: Lakeside Temple (beautiful temple on the beaches of Lake Hylia)  
&gt;  
&gt;Shadow: Temple of Darkness  
&gt;  
&gt;\-  
&gt;  
&gt;FINAL BATTLE WITH THE DEMON KING:  
&gt;  
&gt;King‚Äôs Sanctuary (high atop Hyrule Castle)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some concept art I found that the artstyle could mimic to give the game a fresh feel:

Sherian District (North City): [https://bit.ly/2Qhki7Z](https://bit.ly/2Qhki7Z)

Lakeside District (Near Lake Hylia): [https://bit.ly/2JzugB9](https://bit.ly/2JzugB9)

Natura District (Fairy Woods): [https://bit.ly/2VRn5KY](https://bit.ly/2VRn5KY)

&amp;#x200B;

Breath of the Wild allowed players to explore a natural environment with a few towns scattered around. This game would be the opposite and complimentary of that, allowing players to explore a city environment with a few natural areas scattered about.

truezelda,t3_bropcl,How would this premise work out as a Zelda game?,"a similar post apocalyptic Hyrule setting as in BoTW but with a different twist.

Having their kingdom totally and utterly destroyed and being brought back almost to the stone age, the Hylians Find themselves in the exact same situation the Native Americans faced when the Settlers Arrived during westward expansion, as colonists from an outside kingdom come and claim what was once their land. 

When confronting the settlers they try to bring up their usual claim of being Hylia's Chosen people and that they are not allowed to settle on this land as it's theirs. The settlers simply laugh at them and shrug them off. Seeing the Hylins as inferior and uncivilized savages living amongst the ruins of a once superior civilization. When they do try to force them off their land, the settlers manage to beat them back with more superior technology. paling in comparison with the Hylians inferior weaponry. 

Many hylians would be taken in by the colonists to be used in hard labor. Not as slaves, but as ""indentured servants"".

By the time this version of link is born (As an indentured servant of course) hylian culture and tradition is disappearing rapidly and the hylian people slowly losing their identity of who they once were.

truezelda,t3_bque9h,Why are people wanting a female link when they could be asking for a game you can play as zelda?,"This has always confused me. People want to be able to play as a female character in a LoZ game. That's cool I dig it. But why make a beloved and also main character who is and always has been Male into a female character? Like there are already a bunch of other characters who are female who should have their own game before that. There is a bunch of potential with just Zelda alone considering she is the ruler of hyrule plus she knows magic plus she is a ninja plus she  has a piece of the triforce as well. That alone can give enough gameplay for at least a trilogy of games. Or they could give Linkle an actual game for herself. That way everyone gets what they want. A ""female link"" who isnt actually link. Her crossbows would bring chances for cool new puzzle types plus her not being part of the Big Three as it were would let the story be able to be way more expansive than just ""hey link save hyrule and save the princess"". It could even be ""hey kid link smashed too many pots and now he is in prison in Ganon castle go save him"" or something so that zelda isnt the one who needs saving to change thing up a bit. 

Long story short I dont see why people want link to be female for a game when there are so many other options with so many other already established female characters.

EDIT: I should probably clarify on one part of this. I dont have too much of a problem with a female link. My thing is that everyone is wanting a game with a female link when we could get a game with a female character who we have already met like zelda or urbosa or midna.",291,public,,0

Heck, they could even use River Zora's if they really wanted to keep the Ocean Zora's 'unsullied' and to differentiate River Zora's a bit more.

- Goron's that would live in an icy mountain range with a TON of gems. They would still be miners, but due to all the gems in their habitat they've nurtured a more artistic culture where forging tools and weapons is replaced by architecture, jewel crafting and stone masonry. Maybe as a side effect some of them could either be vain or flamboyant.

truezelda,t3_bqay0g,A Link Between Worlds is a forgettable game that I still enjoyed.," 

I've recently gone back and played a few Zelda games that I enjoyed greatly growing up. Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Majora's Mask 3D, and of course, A Link Between Worlds. I really liked this one for having an easy-to-roam world, although I didn't really remember much about the game. I figured it would be a nice idea to come back and give it another shot.

PLEASE NOTE, THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. THEY WILL BE CENSORED.

**-The Plot-**

I really enjoyed this game's plot. It's a cute little story with some neat twists and turns. Link is an employee at the local blacksmith's shop doing uh.. whatever he does there. They never explain that part. He shows up to work one day when UH OH, the royal guard captain left his sword at the table! When Link finds the captain to return the sword, he's a painting on the wall. This was caused by the villain Yuga, a really fun villain that I feel didn't get enough screen time. You fight him in the Eastern Palace, but I really feel like there could be more scenes with him. Maybe every dungeon (or at least the first 3) has a cutscene with him, then he powers up an enemy like Yoshi's Island? Basically now you have to gather the 3 pendants to access Hyrule Castle and defeat Yuga with the Master Sword. Although when you do so, there's a portal in Zelda's study. Said portal takes you to Lorule! Lorule is essentially this game's version of ALTTP's Dark World, with a lot more interesting content and lore in it. Now you have to rescue the Seven Sages and defeat Yuga (and Ganon too) once and for all! Overall I really appreciate the plot, especially Ravio. Ravio is literally one of my favorite characters in Zelda and he doesn't even do that much. The twist at the end where he's the lorulean Link is pretty cool too.

**-Gameplay-**

The game is very fun to control. I love how fluid Link's movement is and how fast the sword is. Combat with the bow and boomerang on hand is really fun too. Although the game is easy exploitable combat-wise. You could stun an enemy with the boomerang, swing your sword a few times, then stun them with the boomerang again. I found myself using this strategy on most enemies since they're all really the same with different amounts of health. Puzzle-wise the game is lacking too. I never really found myself thinking ""A-ha!"" with any puzzle solution. The puzzles are ridiculously simple with maybe a couple here and there which were kinda clever. I think part of what made the dungeons less satisfying was the way items worked. Instead of you finding an item partway through the dungeon, you can access every item right away. It's a cool idea on paper, but really makes it less interesting. The big main new mechanic that this game introduces is the merging ability. I do really like this ability. Basically going on the wall and travelling on a 2D space. It led to a bunch of really cool concepts, and it was a good addition. I don't have much else to say gameplay-wise.

**-Aesthetics-**

I love this game's visual style. Bright, colorful, and looks like a precursor to Link's Awakening HD's art style. The sound track is pretty great too. A lot of it is orchestral versions of ALTTP music, but the new music is appreciated. The best one is definitely Lorule Castle's theme. Probably the worst theme would be the Ice Temple's theme. That song just gave me a headache with it's random high pitch tones as the whole song. The sound design is pretty varied too. I like link's little sounds. Only thing I thought was weird was the fart-like sound when you hurt or kill a chuchu. Whatever that sound was meant to be will always elude me.

**-Closing Notes-**

The game is solid and is worth a shot, but it is rather forgettable. If you have a kid who's interested in trying a Zelda game, this is a great one to give them due to being easy to understand and run through.",66,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bpols1,Inter-Dimensional Travelers,"Watching the latest Zelda Dungeon video, as they play through ALBW on Hero Mode, I was reminded of a fun fact about the Maiamai that I had totally forgotten. They are inter-dimensional travelers!

&gt;My, oh, my! What business have you with Mother Maiamai? Forgive me if my spirits aren't flying so high. **We were on a great voyage through all the worlds**, my tykes and I... Then I lost sight of my little Maiamais! All 100 of my babies, by and by

&gt;You came just in time! It's a bit sudden, but we must bid you good-bye. **I'm off to a different dimension with my Maiamais!** Oh! But Mother Maiamai doesn't even know your name! Ah...Link. What a nice name. There's nothing more I could do to make it nicer, oh, good friend of mine. My darling tykes owe you their lives. May we see you again, by and by.

&gt;- Mother Maiamai

After she leaves, Link finds that one of her children has remained in Hyrule. 

&gt;Hello there, Link! I'm the 72nd Maiamai you saved! Thanks for all your help. Mom and the others have gone off. But I--? Well, I stayed behind. Time for me to be my own Maiamai.

&gt;Hopefully I'll learn to be as good of a mother as my Mother Maiamai. Wish me luck, Link!

&gt;- 72nd Maiamai (lol)

All of this confirms what's already been implied in the Zelda games, there are multiple dimensions and worlds. Probably many more than we've seen so far.

The Maiamai must be a very powerful race of beings to be able to travel freely to all the different dimensions. Mother Maiamai's great power is implied by her ability to make all of Link's weapons more powerful. She is even able to give Link more power, allowing him to do the Great Spin attack. 

Some beings like the Wind Fish were able to create their own pocket dimensions. It's possible that the Ocean King has also created his own world too. Other races like the Minish are also very powerful, and they were able to travel from their world to Hyrule, originally appearing ""in the sky"".

On the other hand, the Light Spirits used the Mirror of Twilight to banish the Dark Interlopers to another dimension. The Loruleans only discovered Hyrule because of the cracks forming in the reality of their world. 

I've previous theorized that [the Sacred Realm is a spirit world](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/65uxo2/journey_into_the_spirit_world/) or dimension. Rauru says that:

&gt;Long ago I built the Temple of Time... And connected the path to the Sacred Land...

Similarly, the Silent Realms are also spirit worlds or dimensions. 

&gt;As expected, I cannot follow you into this realm, **for this trial calls out to your mind alone. This is the nature of places known as Silent Realms. They are domains of the spirit**, accessible only to the goddess's chosen hero.

Whether all the Silent Realms are connected, and also become the Sacred Realm later on, is not clear. 

Either way, there are many different types of worlds and dimensions in the complex Zelda universe. (Or is that multiverse?) And, the Maiamai suggest that we've only scratched the surface. 

Of course, I haven't mentioned MM and Termina yet. Whatever you believe about the nature of Termina, it's another dimension like the others. You might believe that this parallel world exists on a different plane to Hyrule, or you might believe that it's a pocket dimension that is temporary like in LA. Or you might think it's a combination of both.

But, what really has me curious is the Happy Mask Salesman. Is this guy just a regular Hylian, or is he also an inter-dimensional traveler? The [Masks](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/9/98/MM3D_Happy_Mask_Salesman_Artwork.png?version=2d3638445a231eb0bf6adbd7b24987b7) he has collected seem to point to inter-dimensional travel. At the end of MM, he just vanishs from Termina instantly, without using the portal like Link has to. And, why an obsession with masks? Masks are typically used to disguise one's identity. Is the HMS really an ordinary Hylian, or is this possible inter-dimensional traveler disguising himself? At one point he does say to Link, ""our ancestors"", but if he's hiding his identity, he wouldn't contradict his cover story.

Maybe he's really an alien from another world. With lots of tentacles. Some sort of Lovecraftian horror. Maybe something like [this](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/5/58/MotherMaiamaiModelALBW.png?version=0cdc2b771e80d47b01b73ed618a295ad).

truezelda,t3_bozm45,"Fort Hateno looks like it was defended better than the Citadel, despite lacking the environmental advantage and fire power.","I was reading through the BoTW master book, but I haven‚Äôt read in depth on Fort Hateno.

But it seems as though it was defended much better than the heavily armored Citadel in Akkala. [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/TZdTUB4pybiq8JUn9) you can see the vast amount of guardians defeated before even passing the wall, which seemed impenetrable. We know Link had nothing to do with this fight as his goal was to take Zelda to the fort, before meeting his demise. The other retreating soldiers from the castle fled to the [citadel](https://images.app.goo.gl/xBabWXptF5XEbjmz9) which was clearly overrun with guardians and malice despite the heavier defenses and firepower. However this could be a result of being lacking manpower. However as a military base, should have more than enough troops to defend. Routes taken shown [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/r8uvsCHooVjzw2Y49)

What‚Äôs interesting, however, is that the guardians were sent after Link. Knowing this he still chose Fort Hateno over Akkala. Link, as the noble knight, must‚Äôve known just how powerful Hateno Fort was. With its close proximity to Kakariko, it‚Äôs possible to assume that the sheikah used their technology to defend the fort despite Hylian rule banning the tech due to fear. I say this because let‚Äôs be honest, Hylian weaponry is a pale comparison to sheikah tech, especially when fighting against the likes of a guardian. 

However my only problem with this is it‚Äôs hard to find any sheikah tech weapons without fighting the guardians that world them first. 

Zelda Wikia says that Link and Zelda was defending the fort however they never made it there. Link collapses in ash swamp which is not very far from. So the only other theory I can think of is that Zeldas power spread throughout a much larger area. I plan on reading more into this from the ‚ÄúCreating a Champion‚Äù book later on.

Share your thoughts!


EDIT: FINAL CONCLUSION

Well this was a fun theory, and I wouldn‚Äôt scratch it out *quite* yet. But it seems I found some answers. After some research I‚Äôve found a few key points and arguments.

Not only was it just Hylian soliders, but also a militia of Necluda/Hateno residents. This doesn‚Äôt say what kind, just that it‚Äôs a militia. Whether they were farmers, ex knights or past sheikah warriors. Although, it wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to think some of the militia was made up of ex sheikah warriors. 

Here‚Äôs the kicker, all of the guardians outside of Fort Hateno CANNOT be an accurate estimate. This is because Robbie states that he destroyed a few amount of guardians outside of the walls when testing his ancient technology. He then says he regrets not learning these powers sooner as he believes he could‚Äôve saved Links life with them in the past. This suggests that there may have been a few less guardians than what is seen.  However, for a regular Sheikah scientist, he was able to destroy multiple guardians on his own (despite having a generous helping hand from his arsenal-it‚Äôs still impressive). This is the part that gives me some backbone that ex sheikah were part of the defense. 

My theory suggesting there was only a limited amount of people on the wall to defend was correct.

Final thoughts: Ancient sheikah technology most likely *DIDNT* help defend. There was a vast amount of defenders and fewer guardians than seen at the time of attack. Link taking the blunt force of the assault helped Hateno from being overrun quicker. But as soon as they were about to be taken, Zelda unlocked her power and destroyed the guardians all around the surrounding area. But it‚Äôs also safe to assume that the quick response of the sheikah coming from the same direction as Fort Hateno to help Zelda and Link can be because they were already at the fort fighting. Since it was just a militia.",158,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bmsmfq,"If Sekiro had more puzzles, it would be close to the classic Zelda formula","People kept talking about Dark Souls being the ""true successor of Zelda"" during the Zelda franchise's period of decline. But aside from navigating, opening doors with keys, and lock-on sword combat, I'd honestly more agree with people who see it as a puzzle-less Metroidvania-style Castlevania (sorry; I only use ""Metroidvania"" to refer to the genre as a whole).

But Sekiro, on the other hand, really seems a lot closer to what I imagine as building upon Zelda elements. You have several assignable tools with different functions, you have limited space to equip them, and you need to swap them out to get the ideal loadout for the current situations. Quite a bit of the prosthetic tools even remind me of certain Zelda items. The Shuriken is the bow (basic projectile), the Flame Vent is the lantern or Fire Rod (fire weapon), the Axe is the Hammer (heavy weapon that can bypass certain defenses), the Firecracker is the Deku Nut (daze enemies with a flash), the Mist Raven is the Magic Cape (disappear temporarily), the Loaded Umbrella is a shield, and Divine Abduction is the Deku Leaf (wind blowing tool). And of course, the Grappling Hook is just a hookshot.

I honestly wouldn't want Zelda to learn from Souls, but instead from Sekiro. The ability to upgrade weapons to make them more useful has been done rather half-heartedly in some games in Zelda, but Sekiro increasing their damage and often giving them new moves really makes it worthwhile.

Though of course, Sekiro doesn't really have a significant puzzle element like its Soulsborne predecessors, and Zelda just can't get rid of that when it's such a core element to the franchise. I was actually hoping that there would be some puzzles in Sekiro that would involve shooting switches and activating mechanisms with your tools, but there isn't really much (I won't spoil them, though).

If they can combine Sekiro's tool use in combat with Zelda's puzzle design, the classic Zelda formula would have a new lease on life.",77,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bm5cpr,Evolving the top down zelda format,"After the switch was announced as a console-portable hybrid, one of my first thoughts was that we would be getting top down zelda games on an HD system that we could play on the TV now. I was really really excited by this premise and couldn't wait to see how top down/ ""2D"" zelda games were going to look on hardware capable of breath of the wild, skyrim, and the like. Then Links Awakening was announced. Dont get me wrong I'm really excited for that remake and the art style has definitely grown on me, but i was also a little disappointed. I understand that for a remake you want to keep the structure of the game basically the same, so they stuck to the sort of grid system that the old zelda games stuck to for their map. Assets are placed in square like patterns, and you can only face 8 directions. After seeing hob on the switch though, I realized just how much the formula of what a 2d zelda is could evolve and expand. Any ideas for how they could expand upon it the next time we get a 2d zelda (that isnt a remake)?",60,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bm0vh5,"If Nintendo decided to remaster Ocarina of Time and put in features the Nintendo 64 was incapable of, would you object it? If you would be okay with them making a remaster what would you like to see?","I was inspired by u/darklordoftech's Reddit post about changing OoT 3D, but what if Nintendo remade Ocarina of Time, but with next to no limitations this time around? The original game is nothing if not a masterpiece, but some things definitely could be improved if you ask me.

Hyrule Field was incredibly bland, and it could of done with more unique landmarks, enemies, and NPCs. It would be dope if Hyrule Field had several mini-dungeons scattered around that are completely optional to the game, but have useful dungeon items similar to the Gerudo's Training Grounds. The game could be made into a seemless open world, with no loading screens between locations. More sidequests would of been amazing too. I loved Majora's Mask's time mechanics, and how NPCs had schedules and time could change anywhere even inside dungeons.

One thing that no one talks about but I think is super overlooked is being able to play as the sages in their respective temple. Maybe you could switch between playing as Link and the sage to solve puzzles/fight enemies. For instance in the Forest Temple you could use Saria and her nimble frame to get through crawl spaces that Link could only use when he was younger. She wouldn't be capable of combat though so Link would have to do it. Maybe she could plant seeds that turn into vines that you can climb or something too. Halfway through the temple Phantom Ganon under the guise of the real Ganondorf could come and kill her which would be another great driving force for Link's quest, to avenge his childhood friend. 

Darunia would function probably identical to Goron Link but he'd use the Megaton Hammer rather than his fists. Halfway through the Fire Temple Link and him would get separated by an earthquake caused by Volvagia, so he'd toss the Megaton Hammer across the chasm into Link's hands. After this his fate would be unknown until you enter the Chamber of Sages.

Ruto would have Zora Link's abilities, and maybe should could produce recovery hearts occasionally to show her love for Link. At some point in the dungeon maybe there's a cutscene where she enters a pool of water and doesn't come back out. Turns out Morpha captured her/killed her. 

Impa would be able to climb any surface much like a ninja, and she could use a two handed sword similar to the Biggoron Sword. Give her an infinite supply of Deku Nuts also ;) You could meet her in the ferry room of the Shadow Temple, where she will help you fight off swathes of Stalfos like a badass. Perhaps she goes to scout ahead for Bongo Bongo while you check the next couple of rooms for the Big Key. 

I can't think of anything for Nabooru unfortunately, but it would be cool if she assisted you in the battle against Twinrova somehow.

truezelda,t3_blr7ws,What enemies would you like to see in a BOTW-style Zelda game?,"I'd like to see Darknuts return. They would fast and aggressive like Lynels but have less health and deal less damage. But, unlike Lynels, they would work together with other Darknuts by constructing plans and would use the environment to their advantage. 

They would be defeated by removing their armor and attacking them while they're vulenrable. They would be able to use any weapons Link can. I could see several sub-varieties of Darknuts that have behavioral differences or changes in their moveset.

For example, Fokka could move primarily by jumping or gliding towards like. Tinsuits could aggressively charge at Link with large swiping motions (sort of like the large ogre in Bloodborne). Horseheads could use magic in conjunction with melee weapons (in exchange they don't have alot of armor). Iron Knuckles could be slow, lumbering walls of iron which you must cautiously disarm. There could also a Darknut type which specializes in range weapons or ballistas.

truezelda,t3_bkzdyp,What mechanics or ideas should Zelda borrow from other games / franchises going forward?,"In the past, Zelda games have stuck pretty close to the formula and mechanics laid down by LttP and OoT, and haven't borrowed a ton of conventions or mechanics from other games or franchises. However, BotW decided it was time to start, and added a ton of conventions from the open world genre. It's very possible that Nintendo will do no more borrowing from other franchises from here on out and only work on refining the BotW formula, but it seems equally plausible to me that they could continue to borrow ideas and mechanics from other games, including games outside the open world genre.

**If Nintendo does go down this latter route, what mechanics or ideas should they borrow from other games in the future?**

---

For example, I have three minor mechanics from Dark Souls that I think would really benefit BotW-like games going forward:

* **Real-time animations for consumable items.** BotW (and many other open world games) have an issue with consumables; namely, that when you're low on health you can simply pause the game and eat three-dozen apples to get yourself back to full health. There's no penalty for doing this, and it takes no skill. By contrast, in Dark Souls, if you want to use a consumable item (such as a heal or a buff), your character actually has to complete an animation in real-time; get smacked out of the animation by an enemy before it's finished and you won't gain the benefits of that heal / buff / etc. (and you don't expend the consumable either). By making the player vulnerable while using consumables, it makes using those consumables an actual strategic decision and prevents the player from healing to full for free whenever they take damage. Dark Souls also doesn't allow you to use consumables while in the middle of another action, like climbing a ladder; in BotW this would remove the ability to infinitely refill your stamina meter when climbing by using food.

* **Removing the ability to pause.** The equipment menu would continue to exist as normal, but gameplay would continue in the background while you navigate the menu. This works in tandem with the above change to prevent healing abuse in combat (navigating the menu to get to your healing item leaves you vulnerable as well as actually having to eat it in real-time), and also helps prevent armor-switching abuse ( e.g. using Shiekah armor to sneak up on a group of enemies, and then switching to the Barbarian armor as soon as combat starts.) It's still *possible* to switch armor mid-combat if you're fast enough (I'm so familiar with the Dark Souls menus after several hundred hours of play that I can feasibly change my equipment mid-fight, if I have a second of breathing room), but it becomes much harder, and requires actual skill to pull off.

* **A quick-select menu for consumables.** If eating an apple in combat required you not only to go through an animation but *also* to navigate through the menu, feasibly healing in combat would be basically impossible. Thankfully, Dark Souls circumvents this issue by having a quick-select menu and a button dedicated to item use. You can have up to 5 items in your quick-select menu at a time, and you can choose which of the 5 items is ""active"" by pressing down on the D-Pad to scroll through the 5 items. When you want to use the active item, you just press X. BotW already has similar quick-select menus for equipment (use the D-Pad to select which weapon you want equipped, and then attack with it using Y); they would only have to add a third for consumable items.",53,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bkrvbx,Gregal the Great - A Hero of Men?,"In *The Minish Cap*, [Gregal](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Gregal) is a member of the Wind Tribe, who gives Link the Light Arrows. This old man is part of an optional side quest, so even if you've played through the game, you might have missed him!

I'll just give a brief overview of the side quest. Before reaching the Cloud Tops, where the Wind Tribe resides, during the normal course of the main quest, it's possible to go there earlier through a secret portal. The warp portal opens when Link fuses kinstones with a member of the Wind Tribe in Hyrule Town. Here, Link finds Gregal, a sick old man who is plagued by an evil spirit. Link can save the old man's life by using the Gust Jar to do some ghostbusting. When Link returns to the Cloud Tops, during the main quest, Gregal will reward Link, for saving his life, with the Light Arrows. However, if Link fails to save Gregal's life, before reaching the Cloud Tops in the main quest, Gregal will have died and become a ghost, and it's impossible to get the Light Arrows. 

[Here's a video of the complete side quest.](https://youtu.be/eTOA_WUPtys)

Normally, the Light Arrows or Bow of Light are given to the Hero by Zelda. She has the blood of the Goddess Hylia, and the powerful Light Force inherited from the Minish, explaining why she can produce such a powerful weapon against evil. In TP, they are created by the Light Spirits, and in ST the bow was created by the Spirits of Good (Gods of Light in the Japanese version). Again, a connection to the power of Light. In MM, we don't know the origin of the Light Arrows, but this powerful weapon is kept safe in the Stone Tower Temple. And finally, in WW the Light Arrows are found in Ganon's Tower, seemingly guarded by Phantom Ganon. What? The simplest answer is that they were probably created as a weapon to be used against Ganon, during his pre-Flood attack, but he was able to seize them.

So, why does this old man of the Wind Tribe have the Light Arrows?

Well, when you dig a little deeper into Gregal's past, you find some interesting things.

&gt;In my youth, **I was called Gregal the Great! I was even a little famous**... But lately my limbs have grown heavy, and I can't even stand up...

&gt;**He was a miiiighty hero, they say**. But now he's sick in bed...

In his youth, ""Gregal the Great"" was a ""miiiighty hero"". Perhaps modestly, Gregal claims that he was ""even a little famous"". But, there's even more to learn about this hero:

&gt;Once, my grandfather used something called a Gust Jar to fight monsters.

Yes, the same Gust Jar used to save his life, was once used by him to fight monsters. Link discovers the Gust Jar (È≠îÊ≥ï„ÅÆ„Å§„Åº , Mah≈ç no Tsubo - Pot of Magic, think Journey to the West) in the Deepwood Shrine, one of the four shrines housing an Element. The shrine is Minish-sized, but it was an important place for humans as well:

&gt;Deep within the Minish Woods, you will find a place called Deepwood Shrine. **Once, humans and Picori shared that shrine as a meeting place.**

It's likely then that in the past Gregal had some dealings with the Minish. Some time after he finished using the Gust Jar to fight monsters, it was stored by the Minish in the Deepwood Shrine. 

So, here we have a hero, who knew the Minish, used the Gust Jar, and owned the Light Arrows. Hmmm...

Remember how Gregal is sick when you first meet him?

&gt;**lately** my limbs have grown heavy, and I can't even stand up...

&gt;**I can't believe old Gregal is sick. He was looking so healthy. I guess something just took hold of him...**

Even as an old man, Gregal was very healthy until his sudden illness. An illness with a supernatural cause.

&gt;Nobody believes me, but **I saw a ghost that has taken hold of Granddad!**

&gt;What? **An evil spirit had taken hold of me?** And you drove it away? You... You might be right!... **I can already feel my energy returning! I'll be able to get out of bed soon!**

This sudden illness was caused by an evil spirit attacking Gregal. The sudden increase of monsters in Hyrule was caused by Vaati opening up the Bound Chest. This chest contained the monsters defeated by the Hero of Men, and it was sealed with the Picori Blade. 

Isn't it interesting that one of these monsters, sealed by the Hero of Men, targets a hero now in his old age? Coincidence or revenge?

Of course, there's a couple of reasons why it might be hard to believe that Gregal is the Hero of Men. First of all, he would have to be REALLY OLD. However, we don't know the lifespan of a member of the Wind Tribe. 

Secondly, and more harder to argue against, Gregal has the red hair of the Wind Tribe, whereas the stained glass windows of the Elemental Sanctuary depict the [Hero of Men](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/e/eb/Bound_Chest_War_4.png?version=958b812de39e0138f9a395470de0e85f) as a [blond Hylian](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/3/33/Bound_Chest_War_5.png?version=7df851008dfa9283baa75af459e50c9f). But, how far do we trust the artistic representation of the Hero? It's not an actual photo.

It's important to note too, that this isn't the only time a Hero has been depicted with what looks like [red hair](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/7/71/BotW_Calamity_Ganon_Tapestry.png?version=b4eedc494301845e06b2bc0c3ca51c16). Red hair is not only a distinctive trait of the Gerudo Tribe, but the Wind Tribe as well.

Finally, as was brought up at the beginning, the side quest to get the Light Arrows has a FAIL state. That's extremely rare in a Zelda game, and it makes the character of Gregal even more unique. 

So, is Gregal the Hero of Men? Perhaps. He was definitely a hero. Maybe even a Hero with a capital 'H'. He fought monsters with the Light Arrows and the Gust Jar. He also knew the Minish, who could easily have made the Light Arrows, since they are the source of the Light Force. But, you could also make arguments against him being the Hero of Men. His age and his appearance.

truezelda,t3_bkgbnn,What collectibles wouod you want to add to the next Zelda game?,"My idea, after much consideration, would be a combination of the ring system from the Oracle games and the Outfits from Triforce Heroes.

Basically you'd find unidentified clothing in chests or places around the world (including minigames and quests) that you'd then take to be appraised by an NPC or something. Then you get an outfit or armor that would give you a special ability or effect. The amount of outfits you can carry, like the rings, would be limited from only 1 at the start to up to 3.

This fits the most to me because of 3 reasons:

* It would remove the issue of BotW's reliance upon stats for improving the player's capabilities. Thus, armor would serve special purposes (kind of how some armor already is in BotW but more expanded upon) and enemies would no longer have to be damage sponges to compensate for the player's power.

* It prevents people from simply switching to different armors mid-combat to get the most out of their buffs. For example, sneaking in a full set of Shiekah armor but switching to Barbarian armor when enemies spot you. Or walking in a tundra wearing warm clothes but switching to Knight armor when you encounter an enemy. This sort of system prevents tharlt abuse and makes enemy encounters so much easier.

* There can be extra dialogue from NPCs addressing Link's outfit and be used to complete certain quests that require a disguise or something.

Also bring Kinstones back I love those things. They add extra content to the world and provide it with richness.

Something so wildly unusual and unfamiliar that it jars players who are normally used to seeing the Human protagonists. and being set in a Hyrule even more post-apocalyptic as BOTW (even the other races were wiped out completely) and filled with flora and fauna so alien and so exotic that they both look like something out of a book or documentary (ex: The Future is Wild) on speculative evolution in the future and are a massive departure from the more comfortable ""terrestrial"" flora and fauna as this Hyrule looks more like the surface of an alien planet than Earth.

truezelda,t3_bkggnh,"Why Word of God&gt;Ingame evidence, or why the position of the Truthers amounts to nothing, written by a Traditionalist.","The Truthers, people who deny the official timeline and decry ''old fashioned'' and ''outdated'' beliefs(the OoT-ALttP connection, the third branch,) that we as Traditionalists follow, use the argument that their timeline makes more sense than the official one. Now, I have problems with the ECT myself, but I will admit that if I had to choose an alternative theory alongside the official word, I'd go with it. My timeline pre-HH was pretty much the ECT timeline, obviously without the newer post-HH games and TMC between SS and OoT.

However, let's say for the sake of argument that your timeline makes 10x more sense in terms of in game evidence than the official one without question. 

My question to you is: So what?  

It doesn't matter HOW much sense your headcanon(yes, that's all it is BTW, YOUR headcanon) makes; the whole point of theorizing was to discover the timeline that the people who have a hand in making the games had in mind, not the timeline that mere fans such as yourselves have in mind. That was the number one goal. Without developers/creators/directors, there would be no ''in game evidence'' of anything in the first place, as the games would not exist. By ignoring intent and looking for a timeline that makes sense to you and not the community at large, you're ignoring what the pure goal of theorizing was meant to be in the first place.

That is why, in order to theorize the correct way, we must remain as traditional and conservative as possible.

On a side note, I actually have loads of ideas for such a Hylian noble villain. Like, this Hylian noble could be a well-known and established hero to the citizens of New Hyrule. He could have his own estate or dominion and be very good at manipulation/realpolitik. He could have minions and subordinates who are loyal to him no matter the situation. Basically a slightly more Machiavellian version of Griffith from Beserk.

Personally, I think a ""fall from grace"" kind of story for the new Incarnation of Hatred in the AT would a good introduction and starting point for reviving him in future games. It would give him a tragic yet sympathizable backstory that would add more depth to the story.

truezelda,t3_biud2v,"I Think Breath of the Wild is a Fantastic Game, and a Horrible Zelda Experience","I wasted no time logging my first hours into Breath of the Wild when it first came out; after all, it was the core reason I purchased my Switch. Immediately, I was entrenched in it. The game's sense of exploration and adventure were wondrous. Before long, I had logged 20 hours in just my first week. I logged another 20 in week 2. And then only 10 more over the next 6 months.

A year later, my girlfriend was now living with me, and booted up Breath of the Wild to take it for a spin. She would play it for hours at a time, exploring every crack and crevice. Over the next 9 months, she would put over 200 hours into the game, and after beating it, said it was probably her all-time favorite game.
We were two very likeminded individuals with two vastly different opinions of the same game. How did we come to such differing outlooks on this?
My initial thoughts were ""wow, I must've not played the game the way it was intended. The whole world seems to adore this game, and I just... dont."" So I booted it up for the first time in almost 2 years, made a new profile, and gave it another go. I was off the plateau in 30 minutes flat, and an hour later I turned the switch off out of sheer boredom. I was extremely frustrated; I wanted the same wondrous experience others had. What the hell was wrong with me? It wasn't until I noticed the massive influx of subscribers to r/zelda that I realized my ""problem"". From 2016 onward, the sub went from below 200k subscribers, to around 4 times that at nearly 800k today. This was a marked increase that seems to be directly correlated to Breath of the Wild's release; and the amount of fanart, stories, videos, and questions regarding that one game in particular outweighed the remaining 18 major Zelda titles by a vast margin.

Now, I am getting assumptive by saying Breath of the Wild was many of these 600k Redditors first Zelda game, but it may be safe to say that it was the first they enjoyed, at the very least. And, consequently, it was my girlfriend‚Äôs first game in the series as well. Suddenly, all of the flaws I saw in the game being seen as strengths by its fans made sense. So, allow me to briefly dissect those flaws, and how they could be overlooked by many other players.

The first thing that strikes me about Breath of the Wild that instantly makes me not want to play it is the weaponry. Although I enjoyed my many choices and the different implications it could have in combat, things break waaaay too damn fast. On top of that, when it comes to replayability, starting off picking up rusted swords and shitty wood cutting axes with extremely low durability can be frustrating. The durability also makes certain amazing mechanics lackluster; take, for instance, shield surfing. It‚Äôs really fun, and due to durability, never practical. Increased durability, or a way to repair weapons, would have gone a long way. But many people didn't mind it one bit (my girlfriend included) because the inventory system offers sooo much diversity. So I can let this one slide.

On the subject of menus, we definitely need to talk about food. The whole food system is a big turn off for me. First, you need to gather ingredients, which I don't mind. Then, you go to a campfire with a pot and start cooking (again, no big deal). Then, you hand select up to five ingredients, watch link put them in a pot, watch a cut scene (which you can skip, but still takes time to load into/out of), and then are rewarded with a dialogue box explaining what you made. NOTHING speeds this process up. You know the recipe? Cool story, hand select those five items and we will let you know what it makes that you already know that it makes. And the game makes you feel like it‚Äôs a necessity to cook, and cook often, because of a major mechanic:

Pausing. Now, pausing is a feature in this game a lot of people like. When I asked my girlfriend if she thinks the game would've been better without the ability to pause to change weapons or, more importantly, chow down, she said it would have greatly increased the difficulty and it would've been less fun. It‚Äôs fantastic that the game is accessible to people like my girlfriend who are not worried about ""gittin gud"" and just want to have fun, but for people like me, who want to git gud, why the hell bother? The game basically teaches you that if you spend 10 hours picking up leaves and twigs n shit, and spend another 20 cooking it all, Link can shove an infinite amount of Tupperware dishes into his skirt and never die. The difficulty is dropped to zero by the pause mechanic if you have the patience to gather food and cook it. Of course, you don't have to take advantage of this mechanic to increase the difficulty for yourself, but if cooking were faster and pausing disabled, a boring mechanic could become an interesting one. It is the wasted potential here that bothers me the most. The pause feature never affected a Zelda title‚Äôs difficulty as much as it does this one. Something similar to Twilight Princess‚Äôs quick swap items would‚Äôve been more welcome in my opinion. The ability to pause a fight to eat and switch gear is just too over powered.

My next point is somewhat more controversial amongst the games fans: the soundtrack. I have seen forum posts and YouTube videos both critiquing and defending the games music. My argument is one that I find simple and effective: if Nintendo were to make a non-Zelda open world game about exploration, would you rather have a Breath of the Wild type soundtrack that's reminiscent of hearing Link's text tone go off every 15 minutes, or be serenaded by the sprawling orchestral themes and epic choir arrangements of the Elder Scrolls series? If anyone could look me in the eye and pick the former, I'd eat Jeremy Soule's pants. The musical problem I had with Breath of the Wild is the same I had with Skyward Sword's music: the choice of primary composer. Don't get me wrong, Hajime Wakai has done great work; but when Nintendo opted for a full orchestra for Skyward Sword, Wakai's desire to play Wagner and give everything a motif played off to make a very forgettable soundtrack, with three exceptions: Ballad of the Goddess, Demise's Theme, and the Prologue Theme (and that last one was Koji Kondo). However, Skyward Sword's soundtrack is something I found myself missing after hearing the largely absent soundtrack Breath of the Wild had to offer. Even Ganon's Theme missed the mark for me; many people liked it, but I found the music akin to the fight itself; unpolished and out of place.

Which leads me to my next argument: the boss fights. Much like the Imprisoned of Skyward Sword, it feels like slight variations on the same theme for four fights. Nothing about these bosses excited me when I compared them to previous Zelda bosses. Ocarina of Time had Bongo Bongo and Volvagia, Link's Awakening had the Evil Eagle, Twilight Princess had Stallord, and even Skyward Sword's Koloktos were all memorable to me. In stark contrast, Breath of the Wild's Blight Ganon's faded from my memory so hard I had to Google what bosses were in the game to recall them. With nothing to compare them to, my girlfriend found them memorable. But even with no former Zelda experience, my girlfriend agreed on one point of hatred: shrines and the Divine Beasts.

Holy shit, if there is one thing that kills my desire to play this game again, it would be those two things. The shrines are boring, uninspired, pieced together puzzles centered on a theme usually involving physics, motion controls, or combat. The physics based puzzles are the most inventive and enjoyable, though simple once you have a firm understanding of how to use the Shiekah Slate's abilities efficiently. The combat ones are samey, with some being more difficult than others, but can offer an acceptable challenge. And then there's the motion control ones... and to hell with those (I'm looking at you, tilting maze with rolling ball that I had to cheat to beat by flipping it upside down and just rolling it out). As for the Divine Beasts, well... not much can be said. I found them tedious, with samey designs and uninteresting enemies. Not to mention, they removed my favorite part of a Zelda dungeon; the acquisition of unique items.

Now, I could go on for hours about the things I viewed as flaws in Breath of the Wild, and that's a damn shame. Part of me honestly wishes I didn't have previous Zelda games to compare it to. When I think about Breath of the Wild as a standalone game, I honestly think it‚Äôs pretty damn good. As a Zelda game, I find it falls very short of what I wanted and imagined it to be. I hope that my thoughts on the game are not misconstrued though; I have no intention of trying to stop others from enjoying it, or judging them for doing so. I just wanted to share my point of view, and hope along with any other classic Zelda fan who may share my views that the next major Zelda iteration knocks my socks off like Breath of the Wild did for its fans. Until then, I intend to pick up the remake of Link's Awakening, because that game fuckin rules.

I do apologize that this may come off as grumpy ramblings. I hope to refine my writing style by writing up more critiques like this. I'm planning on doing a more positive Zelda critique soon, if that interests anyone.

I would love to hear anyone's thoughts, and any compelling arguments to my criticisms. I'm always down for a discussion. Thanks for reading!",239,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bin52u,Rito Origins,"I recently found this interesting piece of trivia, and thought I'd share it.

In an [interview with the Zelda manga creators](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/the_legend_of_zelda_manga_interview_translated/), Aonuma revealed the inspiration for the Rito tribe:

&gt;Eiji Aonuma: In Ocarina of Time, as in most Zelda, we have created a large number of tribes, like the Goron who live in the mountains or the Zoras, people from the water. **For the episode ‚ÄúThe Wind Waker‚Äù, when we chose to situate the action in the middle of the ocean, we immediately felt the need to create a race that can move through the air.** During long trips offshore, we needed faster characters capable of transmitting information to Link. **It was at that moment that I remembered Watatara clan, you had invented for the adaptation of ‚ÄúOcarina of Time.‚Äù In short, I digress a bit about the initials but we are inspired by your work to give birth to Rito Race, creatures that are half-man half-bird that can move very quickly with their wings.**

&gt;Honda: In fact, we invented this passage to the needs of the manga. But these characters did never appear elsewhere in the world of Zelda. I think we would have been impossible to imagine all this without the great wealth of the series. When we made the decision to add this passage, we wanted to offer a new breed for the players. However, the only characteristic that we had was to fly.

&gt;Aonuma: Ha ha ha! We have therefore followed the same reasoning!

&gt;Nagano: Indeed, when we reflect on the particularities and details of their lives, only the birds had not yet played a major role in Zelda and only the sky was still uninhabited.

The Watarara tribe has an entry in the Zelda Wiki: https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Watarara

Images of them can be seen here:

[Image 1](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/6/6c/RouruoftheWatawara.png)

[Image 4](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/f/f0/Rouru.png)

As you can see, the design of the BotW Rito is closer to the Watarara than the WW Rito, which they originally inspired.

Another interesting point is that in the manga, the Watarara are a migratory species, passing through Hyrule. This same behaviour might help give an in-game explanation why the BotW-style Rito weren't in any previous versions of Hyrule. They hadn't settled there yet. After all, the [mural found in TPHD](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRBEE1qjF8Dq5F2TeNaOkDTnERM7CIcKRMaOiSI6edO6a-2sPMf) shows that the kingdom had some sort of contact with a bird-like race in the past. 

As for an in-game lore origin, there have been a number of theories. 

My headcanon was that the BotW Rito came from the [Fokka](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Fokka) and the [Fokkeru](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Fokkeru), guardians placed by the King in the Great Palace, to protect the ToC. Others have suggested that they evolved from Loftwings.

Gaepora calls the Loftwings ""guardian birds"", so maybe the Fokka and Fokkeru came from them, or maybe they are ancient Rito warriors who were selected by the King. Or maybe it's both.

However, I recently discovered something interesting. In TMC, Link gains an item linked to the Wind Tribe, the Ocarina of Wind. Using this ocarina summons the bird [Zeffa](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Zeffa), who will carry Link to any of the Wind Crests he's found. In Japanese, Zeffa is called „É™„Éà„É≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ (Ritorokku) - Ritoroc.

Now, ""roc"" can be found on the end of the names of a number of flying creatures in the Zelda games. But, this is the only instance, that I can find, of ""rito"" being used in any game that doesn't have the Rito tribe in it. This makes Ritoroc unique. 

So, is Zeffa, or Ritoroc, a link in the chain of evolution that led to the BotW Rito? Or is it connected to the Rito tribe in a different way? Either way, I think there is a connection.",81,public,,0

As I've written more on The Legend of Zelda, I've found myself wanting to better discuss the elements that I believe make up the series while also shining a light on what happens when those elements are removed or reworked. All things considered, Link's Awakening is pretty traditional, but it's traditional in a way that doesn't necessarily abide by the franchise's sense of tradition.

I'm just really sick of it, and that's probably why I don't care whether Zelda should stick to its roots or go in new directions. I'll happily take both, just as long as the execution of either is fine.

Besides, OoT and MM share a lot of the same strengths: quick pacing that gets you from one story event to the next, lovable characters, compelling villains that are threatening and have a presence in the story, fun optional items that reward exploration, worlds that balance area to walk around with tons to find, among other things. On the other hand TP and SS share a lot of the same downfalls: long-winded menial quests that blocks your progress between dungeons, forgettable characters (Midna and Groose aside), villains that lack either presence or threat factor, only optional items being Rupees or Heart Pieces, worlds that are flat and boring, among other things.

The Ancient Cistern. When you think of that temple, do you picture [this](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/5617728_orig.png)? It's an iconic temple. But, why is there a statue that looks like Buddha in a Zelda game? How does that even work in the lore of SS, and what does it really represent? 

It's not actually called the Ancient Cistern in the Japanese version of the game. Âè§„ÅÆÂ§ßÁü≥Á™ü (Inishie no Daisekkutsu) - Great Ancient Cavern. However, calling it a cistern in the English version is fitting:

&gt;In this Ancient Cistern, purified water is released into the upper area of the facility, while the filtered impurities are processed in the lower area.

&gt;- Fi

It's a facility for purifying water. It's also where Faron, the Water Dragon, protects the Sacred Flame of Farore. Housing the Sacred Flame was probably not the reason why the Ancient Cistern was built, but it came to be used that way later.

&gt;The goddess gave the flame to the Water Dragon, a great spirit that presides over Faron Woods.

&gt;The way I hear it is **she left the flame in the care of the Water Dragon so that one day the mighty dragon could pass it on to the ""one from the sky""**...

&gt;- Yerbal, the Kikwi Hermit

Hylia's preparation for her chosen hero from the sky came at the end of the Era of the Goddess. But the purification of the water would have been something that started earlier.

**Water of Life**

The Faron Woods region is intimately tied to the element of Water. 

&gt;The plentiful water in this region clearly sustains a large diversity of flora, including this massive tree.

&gt;- Fi

Water means life for the forest, and its inhabitants. The importance of water to this region is illustrated by its protector.

&gt;Her name is Faron, **the Water Dragon**. As the great protector of Faron Province, **she has power over water**.

&gt;- Fi

What is the source of the water in the Faron Woods region?

To the southeast of the forest is Lake Floria. In Japanese its name is „Éï„É≠„É™„Ç¢Êπñ - Lake Furoria. Just like Faron, both woods and dragon, this name is derived from the name for the Goddess Farore in Japanese, „Éï„É≠„É´ - Furol. The word floria, in English, is also related to flowers. This is superficially appropriate for the lush plant life of the forest, but it's also very fitting when we consider the Ancient Cistern in more detail later on.

Lake Floria feeds the underground waterways beneath the forest, and it's deep within one of these caverns that Faron, the Water Dragon, has her hall. The caverns are also the home of the Parella, an aquatic race that serve the Water Dragon.

These underground waterways actually extend beyond the forest and provide water, and therefore life, throughout the Surface regions. 

&gt;What? There's some fire blocking your path? Why don'tcha just pour some water on it and move on?

&gt;Ya need how much water? Whoa... I get it. So the water we got here's not enough, right?

&gt;You know, **I hear the little water we got here is fed by some far-off water source called Lake Floria**.

&gt;So **a buddy of mine went huntin' for treasure in Faron Woods, and he told me he used the waterways there to find his way back home. He tells me Lake Floria was just about the biggest lake you could imagine**. Bet if you checked it out, there'd be enough water there to solve your dilemma.

&gt;- Mogma, the Eldin Volcano region 

So, the water from Lake Floria sustains not only the life in the Faron Province, but even into the Eldin Province. Is it possible that the extensive mining in the Lanayru Province disrupted these waterways, and contributed to the region turning into a desert?

But, what is the source of water for Lake Floria itself? The only clue we have is [this](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/9623583.jpg?1490641606). These waterfalls feed into the lake from the south. We have no idea where all this water comes from, because it goes beyond the borders of the map. If they are the end of a large river, then there's probably a mountainous region to the south, since rivers do not normally travel north.

As Fi mentioned above, the Ancient Cistern was used to purify water, and then store it. Interestingly, there are two types of water that Link can find in the Faron Woods region, **ordinary water** and **sacred water**. Ordinary water can be found everywhere, and it well describes the water coming from Lake Floria, and its waterways. Sacred water can only be obtained from the two sacred springs, the Sky Spring, and the Earth Spring.

What is the difference between ordinary water and sacred water?

&gt;Your current location is the Sky/Earth Spring. It is a sacred place protected by the power of the goddess.

&gt;According to legend, **the water here purifies the body of any life-form that comes into direct contact with it**.

&gt;- Fi

&gt;You got some **Sacred Water**! This pure water can heal the wounds of the Water Dragon. **It has mystical properties that cannot be found in ordinary water**.

&gt;You got **Sacred Water**! **It may look like ordinary water, but this pure water contains a powerful energy. Absolutely pure water from the Skyview Spring**.

&gt;- In-game descriptions 

&gt;**My analysis of the water here reveals an extraordinarily high concentration of energy**.

&gt;There is a **strong likelihood that this energy will be amplified upon contact with an object of conforming wavelength**.

&gt;- Fi 

Sacred Water is absolutely pure water that contains an extraordinarily high concentration of energy. It can be used to purify the body of any life-form. For example, Zelda needed to bathe in both Springs to purify herself. In doing so, she regained the memories and power of Hylia.

Another example of the purifying power of Sacred Water is using it to heal the wounds of the Water Dragon. These serious injuries were caused by Ghirahim. The damage inflicted was not only physical, but spiritual. 

&gt;The **wounds he's given me are stubborn things**. I have been **forced to recuperate in this basin of sacred water**. Unfortunately, **the healing properties of the sacred water have diminished, and I am now in need of another dose to freshen up my healing bath**. Bring me the container of **fresh sacred water that I require**.

So, Sacred Water can lose its special properties when used to purify someone. This is probably because the high concentration of energy inside the water is transferred to the person being purified. When Fi says, ""there is a strong likelihood that this energy will be amplified upon contact with an object of conforming wavelength"", the object she's referring to is probably a powerful spirit, like the Water Dragon. It's an interesting mix of scientific terms with magic.

**Filthy Curses**

Another reason why the Sacred Water loses its power is probably because it becomes polluted. In washing away the impurities causing the wounds, the water becomes contaminated. It's likely that the sacred energy within the water is replaced with a cursed energy. 

&gt;The cursed energy supply Ghirahim provided to this contraption has given it power far beyond its conventional limits.

&gt;- Fi, talking about Koloktos

Cursed energy gives a number of enemies in SS the power to curse Link. Here's some examples:

&gt;Target lock: Cursed Spume

&gt;This mysterious monster's **natural habitat includes poisonous swamps and other dangerous environments**. It spits evil **curses that it stores up in its body**.

&gt;Target lock: Dark Lizalfos

&gt;This beast has superb fighting skills and uses an iron arm guard. Watch for quick counterattacks when your attacks are repelled, Master. **The creature's breath can cause a curse that will prevent you from using your sword**, so I recommend exercising extreme caution.

&gt;Target lock: Dark Keese

&gt;Found in many locations, these winged **monsters are attracted to dark places**, such as caves.

&gt;- Fi 

The examples of the Cursed Spume and the Dark Keese point towards a connection between monsters with cursed energy and their environment. A poisonous swamp, and dark places, are not exactly environments where sacred life would flourish. You wouldn't call the water found in a poisonous swamp pure. It's contaminated, impure, and the life found there reflects that. Traditionally, the same is said for dark places, where there is no light. In fantasy and mythology, nothing good and pure lives and grows in those types of places.

Taken to the extreme, the most contaminated, or impure, form of life would be undead ‚Äúlife‚Äù.

&gt;Target lock: **Cursed Bokoblin**

&gt;**This horrifying Bokoblin reanimates after death**. Analysis indicates it fears pure, shiny items and will startle at the sight of a sacred shield. It is **able to reanimate purely through its hatred of this world**...and its attachment to outlandish underpants.

&gt;Target lock: Staldra

&gt;This is a snake monster from before the dawn of time. Three bone-plated heads and **a thirst to cause pain keep it writhing even beyond death**. My analysis shows that to defeat **this cursed snake**, all three of its heads must be simultaneously destroyed.

&gt;- Fi 

The undead are described as cursed. Their hatred energizes them, giving them life beyond death. You could say that they're powered by the same energy that the Demon Lord Ghirahim uses ‚Äì cursed energy.

That energy sometimes crystallizes and is left behind from defeating enemies with cursed energy:

&gt;You got an Evil Crystal!  This solid chunk of pure, **crystallized monster malice** is extremely rare!

&gt;- In-game description 

&gt;Evil Crystal. It may be possible to **obtain one by defeating a monster that can curse**.

&gt;- Fi 

&gt;Evil Crystals often come from monsters that cast spells. **Dark magic**... It gives me chills...

&gt;- Sparrot

So, what was the point of taking this detour, away from discussing water, into cursed energy?

I've largely avoided referencing lore from other Zelda games in this series, but I think it's pretty clear what is happening in the example of the Water Dragon. Ghirahim uses, ""cursed energy."" There's really no doubt that this demonic energy is what other Zelda games refer to as **Malice**. In fact, Evil Crystals, are described as ""pure crystallized monster malice"". On the other hand, the sacred energy constantly referred to in SS, including in Sacred Water, is certainly **Force**. In other Zelda games, Force is defined as the sacred power found in all living things. It is the power of life itself, which was granted by the Golden Goddesses.

So, the sacred and pure energy of life found in Sacred Water can be used to wash away impurities, including the defilement caused by demonic, or cursed, energy.

**Once Upon A Time In Mythical Japan**

To help us understand this concept better, I think it's important to understand what its likely inspiration was - Shintoism.

Shinto is the only religion native to Japan. Other religions like Buddhism were introduced from foreign countries. Shinto means ""the way of the kami (gods)"" The kami are the gods or spirits of the world, but [the definition is very broad](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/01/20/national/history/adulteration-japans-oldest-religion/#.XIY6xOjZVxC):

&gt;It includes human beings. It also includes such objects as birds, beasts, trees, plants, seas, mountains and so forth. In ancient usage, anything whatsoever that was outside the ordinary, which possessed superior power or which was awe-inspiring, was called kami. ‚Ä¶ Evil and mysterious things, if they are extraordinary and dreadful, are called kami.‚Äù

So, kami can be *anything extraordinary or awe-inspiring*. That includes demons and monsters. But kami are not strictly divided between good and evil. A gentle kami can become terrifying if angered, and a frightening kami may be pacified.

&gt;All things in heaven and earth are in accordance with the august will of the kami. Among the kami there are good ones and bad ones. Their actions are in accordance with their different natures, so they cannot be understood by ordinary human reason.

Morality, as taught by many other religions, good and evil, is not a concern of the Shinto religion. 

&gt;Shinto teaches nothing, enjoins nothing, demands no submission, works no miracles, **effaces evil by cleansing it**, transmutes dread into joy. There is no heaven, no hell, no nirvana ‚Äî just ‚Äúthe rising sun each morning,‚Äù ‚Äúthe coming of the kami.‚Äù

However, as is mentioned in the above quote, cleansing evil is an important concept in the Shinto religion. Kami are worshipped, not in majestic temples like in Buddhism, but in simple shrines. These shrines may be constructed, but they can also be places in nature, such as a sacred grove of trees, mountains, springs, or waterfalls. In Japan, many Shinto shrines are attached to a much larger Buddhist temple. This reminds us, in SS, of the Sacred Springs found deep within the Skyview and Earth Temples. The shrines of the Sacred Springs were probably used before the temples, that were created later on to protect them.

Before someone enters a Shinto shrine they must [perform a ritual purification](https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/purification-core-ancient-shinto-faith-003108). The person uses a basin of water, and a long wooden spoon, to cleanse their hands and mouth. This is the simplified version of a more complex ritual that is performed in a river, or near a waterfall. Anyone who visits a shrine, even a tourist who doesn't believe in Shintoism, must purify themselves if they want to enter the shrine. 

&gt;The purification is necessary to keep the shrine pure and the atmosphere cleansed.

&gt;Before entering the shrine, one must completely cleanse him/herself of the unnatural world and this is symbolized in this shortened version of the formal purification ritual.

So, the purification helps to keep peace with the kami. The mythological origin of the purification ritual is told in the story of the two kami who created the islands of Japan. Izanagi and Izanami were brother and sister, and also husband and wife. Izanami died giving birth to the fire god. Izanagi decided to visit his dead wife in the Underworld, or Yomi (""the shadowy land of the dead"", also called Ne-no-kuni, land of roots and Soko-no-kuni, the hollow land).

Unfortunately, Izanami could not leave since she had already eaten food of the Underworld, and had become one with it. Then, Izanagi accidentally saw his wife's hideously decomposing body by torchlight and fled in terror. Izanami was enraged by this betrayal and chased after him. So, Izanagi sealed the entrance to the Underworld with a giant stone, blocking his wife's escape. 

But, Izanagi had become unclean from the impurities of the Underworld, so he cleansed himself by ritual purification in a river. From this cleansing ritual were born the other Shinto gods, such as the sun goddess Amaterasu.

We don't have to be experts in the Shinto religion to see the connections between this myth and Zelda mythology, especially as it connects to the purifying power of water. Also, I'm not claiming that there is a 1:1 correspondence between the two, but the inspiration is clear, and it gives us greater context. Water purifies and it gives life. Impurities are ultimately connected to the Underworld, a place of death and demons.

As Fi mentioned above, the filtered impurities were processed in the lower areas of the Ancient Cistern. It's interesting to see that the underground section of the Ancient Cistern looks very much like the Underworld. It's almost a mini Dark World. Could the intense concentration of impurities in that area contribute towards this transformation? Are the cursed enemies attracted to the corruption of the area, or were they corrupted by it themselves?

*The second part of this post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/bfnsh1/the_ancient_cistern_ii_to_inspire_gratitude/).*

To be clear, I don't think the ancient humans were so focused on purity and gratitude all the way back in the beginning, when they were still the children of the forest. Nor when they spread into the Eldin Province, or perfected their technology in Lanayru Province. I believe this shift in their culture happened after they left the Lanayru Province to the automation of the Ancient Robots. They had reached the heights, scientifically and commercially, exploring everything they could of the world around them, and now their focus turned inward. 

Perhaps there had always been a group of humans that were interested in self-improvement, in purifying themselves and exploring the spiritual side of their souls. As Batreaux's tale highlights, maybe it was the discovery of Gratitude Crystals that convinced everyone else that this was something worth pursuing.

But why?

Well, if Gratitude can transform a demon, what can it do for a human?

Again, the key to answering that question seems to be the great statue of the Ancient Cistern.

As Link navigates through the Ancient Cistern, he changes the position of the statue in the temple. The different positions of the statue, and Link's journey through the temple, tell a story about the ultimate goal of the ancient humans. 

**The Spider's Thread**

To understand the story told through the Ancient Cistern, it's impossible to ignore the most famous inspiration for its design. The 1938 Japanese short story, *The Spider's Thread*, by Ryunosuke Akutagawa. The connection between this Buddhist fable and the Ancient Cistern was first highlighted by Robert from Zelda Dungeon in this [article](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/allegories-in-architecture-the-ancient-cistern/). I highly recommend that you read the article, and the series it is a part of, in which Robert also explores the lore of SS. Many of our interpretations differ, but they are no less valuable, and his series was a huge inspiration for me.

Here's how Robert summarizes *The Spider's Thread*:

&gt; The Buddha Shakyamuni was strolling alone alongside a lotus pond in Paradise. Between two lotus leaves and through crystal clear celestial water, the Buddha peered into hell. Among the suffering he observed a man by the name Kandata, whose sole good deed in life was sparing the life of a spider while walking through the woods. Touched by this act of compassion, the Buddha lowered a string of silver thread, taken from a spider in Paradise, to save Kandata from damnation. Kandata, overjoyed by the thought of not having to drown in the Lake of Blood at the bottom of hell or chased up the mountain of Needles again, began climbing the thread to Paradise. When the shadows of hell began to fade and the light of Paradise was visible, he looked down at the other sinners. Terrified by the assembly of people climbing the thread, Kandata feared it may break under their weight ‚Äì and began yelling, kicking, and screaming ‚Äì telling them this fate belonged to him and him alone. At that moment, the thread broke, and Kandata was flung back into the lake of blood with the rest of the sinners. The Buddha shook his head in disappointment, and continued his morning stroll along the banks of the lotus pond. Even an eternity of punishment, he thought, could not instil an ounce of compassion in the man.

It's easy to see the connections between this story and the design of the Ancient Cistern. A [Buddha-like figure, and a lotus pond](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/5617728_orig.png) with crystal clear celestial water, in Paradise. Beneath the lotus pond are the [depths of hell](http://i.imgur.com/sbMJ3.png), with its own version of the [lake of blood](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/8128126.png?1490641663). And, who could forget the [climb up the spider's thread](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/2785681_orig.png) with the denizens of hell scrambling after you? Why, the designers even thought of putting [spiders, or Skulltulas, in the Paradise](http://i.imgur.com/WD8d0.png) section of the temple!

So, the inspiration for the designers is clear, but what does any of this even mean in the world and lore of SS, if anything? Buddhism doesn't exist in Zelda. 

Well, the moral of the story, and its themes, do tie into what we've been discussing so far. Kandata failed to ascend into Paradise, because he had failed to learn compassion. While he had done some good in his life, he had not purified his heart any further. Instead of displaying gratitude, he showed selfishness. 

It's therefore likely that the Ancient Cistern temple was used to teach the ancient humans a similar lesson. The need to purify themselves and learn gratitude. 

""BUT WHY?"", I hear you yelling at me. Why would they care about doing any of that? What did they believe that purification and gratitude could do for them?

The great statue illustrates the desired result of this process, as shown [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/9055120_orig.png).

To help us unpack what this symbolizes, it's finally time to discuss all the blatant Buddhist symbolism in the Ancient Cistern. 

**Mind Blown**

Here's some of the Buddhist symbols, and concepts, found in the Ancient Cistern, and SS in general.

* **Sacred Lotus Flower:** This symbol is found, in various forms, all over the Ancient Cistern, as seen [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/5617728_orig.png), [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/1349719_orig.png) and [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/9122000_orig.png). The Sacred Lotus Flower, https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_(attribute), represents ""creation and cosmic renewal and ""primordial purity"""". It is also ""symbolic of purity of the body, speech, and mind as while rooted in the mud, its flowers blossom on long stalks as if floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. It is also symbolic of detachment as drops of water easily slide off its petals.""

* **Dharmachakra:** Also known as the Dharma Wheel, or ""Wheel of the Law"", represented by a [wheel with eight spokes](http://i.imgur.com/A90nl.png). It symbolizes the Buddha and his teaching, which will lead to enlightenment and nirvana, known as the Noble Eightfold Path. The gears which move the giant statue in the Ancient Cistern are shaped like wheels with eight spokes. The symbol can also be seen [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/4526974_orig.jpg) in the Earth Temple. 

* **Crown Chakra:** Also known as [Sahasrara](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahasrara) (not Sahasrahla but very close! The Japanese name is almost identical, „Çµ„Éè„Çπ„É©„Éº„É© - SahasurƒÅra), it is the [topmost chakra](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Chakras_map.svg), located in the crown of the head. The Crown Chakra is symbolised by a [lotus flower with 1,000 petals](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Sahasrara_Mandala.svg/1024px-Sahasrara_Mandala.svg.png). It is believed to be the highest spiritual centre, and the state of pure consciousness. Activating this chakra gives a person supernatural powers - powers of transforming into the divine, and being able to do whatever one wishes. I think you'll find it interesting to see how the Crown Chakra is [sometimes symbolised](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Ayyavali_Sahasrara.PNG). Of course, the Crown Chakra directly relates to the [image](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/9055120_orig.png) of the Ancient Cistern that we want to unpack.

* **Fish:** Yes, fish are one of the [Ashtamangala](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtamangala), or Eight Auspicious Signs, sacred symbols in Buddhism. They ""symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water."" As mentioned earlier, a [fish](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/5467215_orig.jpg) forms the entrance to the Ancient Cistern.

* **Water:** According to [this article](https://moonpointer.com/new/2011/02/significance-of-water-in-buddhism/), ""the offering of water at Buddhist shrines symbolizes the aspiration to cultivate the virtues of calmness, clarity and purity of body, speech and mind. It reminds us to diligently cleanse ourselves of our spiritual defilements of attachment, aversion and delusion through the generating of generosity, compassion and wisdom. Upon perfection of these qualities, enlightenment (synonymous with True Happiness) will be realised."" It also ""reminds us to purify ourselves, to reveal our innate Buddha-nature."" ""Water also represents the sweet 'nectar' of the Buddha's teachings, which quenches our spiritual thirst and nourishes us spiritually.""

* **Prayer Wheels:** They are mainly used in Tibetan Buddhism. [Prayer Wheels](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Tibetan_monastery_Prayer_Wheel.jpg/2560px-Tibetan_monastery_Prayer_Wheel.jpg) are inscribed with a mantra, typically Om Mani Padme Hum (Padme means ""lotus flower"".). Spinning them is viewed as the same as verbally repeating the mantra. The mantra is used to build good karma, and reduce bad karma. It's interesting then that these [large spinning wheels](http://i.imgur.com/p0dKl.png) are found in the underground section of the Ancient Cistern, and used by Link to escape it. It's also said that whoever knows this mantra will experience liberation as a fully enlightened Buddha (keep reading to find out what this means).

Apart from these visual symbols, the Ancient Cistern touches on a very important concept in Buddhism, the cycle of rebirth. Known as samsƒÅra - https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa·πÉsƒÅra_(Buddhism), life is a ""cycle of repeated birth, mundane existence and dying again."" The goal of Buddhism is to break free of this cycle. It is not viewed as a positive thing. ""Rebirths occur in six realms of existence, namely three good realms (heavenly, demi-god, human) and three evil realms (animal, ghosts, hellish)."" Where, and into what, you are reborn depends on your karma.

According to Buddhism, life is an endless cycle of suffering. This suffering, and continual rebirth, is caused by craving, or desire, and ignorance. If someone is able to completely eliminate their cravings and ignorance, through enlightenment, then they will experience liberation from the cycle of rebirth - nirvana - https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(Buddhism). Nirvana literally means ""blowing out"" or ""quenching"".

The earliest Buddhist interpretation of Nirvana was that it was an ending to rebirth, and therefore an end to existence. From an outsider's point of view, this is a fairly nihilistic view of life. Life is endless suffering, so the goal is to end it. However, later interpretations of Nirvana changed its meaning. One interpretation is that it means achieving transcendent consciousness beyond time and space. A metaphysical place of pure consciousness.

In MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, which is the branch of Buddhism practised in Japan, the ultimate goal is not just to reach nirvana, but to attain Buddhahood. To become a Buddha yourself. A Buddha is not just happy with their personal salvation in nirvana. They want to help as many other beings as they can to also become a Buddha. To do this, a Buddha cannot remain in the realm of Nirvana. They must reenter the cycle of rebirth, samsƒÅra, to help and teach others. However, because a Buddha has achieved omniscience, they are still in a state of nirvana while helping others. The MahƒÅyƒÅna text, or scripture, teaching the path to Buddhahood is called the Lotus Sutra.

How does any of this relate to the Ancient Cistern?

As you know, the Ancient Cistern is mainly divided into two sections. The beautiful lotus pond above is the picture of a heavenly paradise, while the underground section is hellish. These two sections remind us of the two extreme realms, found in the six realms of existence, into which someone may be reborn. The great statue reminds us of Buddha. Its body is in the heavenly paradise, but [its feet are in hell](http://i.imgur.com/hjXoc.png). Buddha reenters the cycle of rebirth in order to help others. However, just like Buddha, the great statue's head is elevated into the lotus wreath decorating the ceiling. While living in the world, Buddha still exists in a state of Nirvana, his seventh chakra is activated. This is the goal he inspires others to achieve. The great statue of the Ancient Cistern seems to be inspiring a similar goal for the ancient humans. 

Here are some more connections to Buddhism in *Skyward Sword*.

Remember, in the story of *The Spider's Thread*, Buddha's full name was ""Buddha Shakyamuni"". SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama, who became known as Buddha, was the Indian religious leader who founded Buddhism. He was also known as ""Shakyamuni"". Interestingly, Shakyamuni means ""Sage of the Shakyas"". So, Buddha was a Sage.

Therefore, if the giant statue in the Ancient Cistern is a reference to Buddha, in the world of SS it could also symbolize a Sage. Sages are well known in Zelda lore, and they are alluded to in SS. The ceiling of the Temple of Hylia is illustrated with a [mural](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/3/31/Sealed_Temple_mural.png) depicting the Triforce surrounded by the symbols of the Six Elements. In OoT, six of the Sages were linked to those Elements. Is it possible that, in the Era of the Goddess Hylia, there were six Sages connected to those Elements as well? If so, is the giant statue in the Ancient Cistern depicting a Sage?

One of the Six Elements is Spirit. However, translating from the Japanese È≠Ç, it would be more accurate to call it [Soul](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/98b5em/temples_of_the_six_elements/). It's referring to soul, or spiritual energy, not spirits and gods. A temple, and Element, based around the soul is not that different to the Ancient Cistern temple and its focus.

Another connection between lotus flowers and enlightenment is found in the Silent Realms.

To enter a Silent Realm, Link must open a Trial Gate. As a Trial Gate opens, it appears as the petals of a lotus flower unfurling one at a time. The [open Trial Gate](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/0/07/Trial_Gate_3.png) is very similar in appearance to the [Crown Chakra](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Ayyavali_Sahasrara.PNG) highlighted above, complete with triangle in the centre. Remember that the Crown Chakra is related to pure consciousness, the highest spiritual centre, and lotus flowers can symbolise purity of mind. This is appropriate when we consider what the Silent Realm is:

&gt;The **Silent Realm is a spirit world** that only the goddess's chosen hero is allowed to enter. You have **separated from your physical form and exist in this world as a spirit**. The tasks you perform here **test your spiritual resolve**. You must focus and complete the trial.

Notice how Fi describes it:

&gt;As expected, **I cannot follow you into this realm, for this trial calls out to your mind alone**. This is the nature of places known as Silent Realms. They are **domains of the spirit**, accessible only to the goddess's chosen hero. This particular trial, Farore's Silent Realm, tests the limits of your courage.

&gt;**Your spirit has temporarily separated from your physical body** so that you may undertake this challenge. To reach the location of the flames that will enhance your sword, it is necessary for you to overcome this trial and **undergo spiritual growth**.

In the Silent Realm, spiritual growth comes from avoiding the Watchers and Guardians, and collecting Sacred Tears to fill your Spirit Vessel. The Spirit Vessel looks like [this](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/d/d7/SilentRealm5.png).

&gt;You got the Spirit Vessel! This **mysterious plant represents your spirit**, Link.

&gt;- In-game description 

&gt;That is your Spirit Vessel. **When this vessel is full, it will signify you have successfully completed the trial, allowing your spirit to grow**. This, in turn, will allow the goddess to bless you with a new power.

&gt;- Fi 

When you have collected all the Sacred Tears, Link is told:

&gt;You collected every last Sacred Tear. **Link's spirit has grown**! The trial will continue until you exit the Silent Realm. Proceed with caution on your way back to the entrance so that you can **claim proof of your personal growth**.

Returning to the Trial Gate transforms the Spirit Vessel into the [bud of a flower](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRYdxje1lpJHWqSAT4ot3c4kbZuuxtcMkvFOAA8SZSBtLVH5t6h). The bud then opens to reveal one of the Goddess' Sacred Gifts.

So again, SS provides us with a clear connection between the symbol of a flower to spiritual growth and the mind.

One interesting point about the Silent Realms is that they have their own version of water - Waking Water. If Link touches it, the Guardians will awaken and chase after him. The Zelda Wiki has an intriguing piece of trivia about Waking Water, that I haven't been able to verify. 

&gt;If Link looks at the Waking Water, he can see the Triforce with the Marks of the Goddesses in the center of each triangle. For some reason, Farore's and Nayru's marks appear on the left and right respectively, when it should be the opposite.

Of course, the ToC and the ToW would be reversed if the Waking Water is showing a reflection... What could this mean?

Another connection to Buddhism is the design of Koloktos. In Japanese his name is È≠îËùïÁ•ûÂô®„ÉÄ„Éª„Ç§„É´„Ç™„Éº„Éû (Ma Shoku Shinki Da Iru≈çma) - Demon-tainted Sacred Instrument: Da Iru≈çma. Koloktos is a Sacred Instrument that was corrupted by the Demon Lord Ghirahim. This is ironic when we consider everything we've learned about the Ancient Cistern. The design of Koloktos is inspired by an Asura - https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura_(Buddhism). Asuras are Buddhist demigods or titans. Depictions of them can be seen [here](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR56HER5FSed6ZWt3kwDw-6KcPFa558ahfFLZnwf015Z45KBUdtYykPDD7K), [here](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSvYWFPP4xBLi4bp4y4FUM6y8RcvucOaR9qH_fW6jsva4LVIg11uk2o_eS), and [here](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRU8e2xhrKyAw5_xRWkT059NCLgC8kueVhm6BNldXxfz60JFuBu01eVugKFXw). They are described as having three heads with three faces each and either four or six arms.

The Ancient Cistern has another multi-armed foe, the [Stalmaster](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/1/18/StalmasterSS.png). This enemy is the mini-boss of the Ancient Cistern. This is Fi's analysis of it:

&gt;This is an elite captain of the undead soldiers. When provoked, it has the ability to strike with all four of its sword-wielding arms. 

Knocking off its helmet reveals that it has a [third eye](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQFosaD48BWtDhKgth4YuRvKhHRvLk7pY4ZzFSvXOA89oEOkqXT) in the centre of its forehead. The Third Eye is the sixth chakra, Ajna, symbolised by a lotus flower with two petals. It signifies perception beyond ordinary sight, and opening this chakra leads to higher consciousness and enlightenment. 

Finally, the concept of rebirth, or reincarnation, in Buddhism is also found in the Zelda series. For instance, both Kaepora Gaebora from OoT, and Satori from BotW, are said to be the reincarnation of ancient Sages. Tingle claims to be the reincarnation of a Fairy. And, in SS we have Zelda, who is the mortal reincarnation of the Goddess Hylia. 

In line with the theme of reincarnation and rebirth, one of the enemies found in the top section of the Ancient Cistern is [Furnix](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/3/38/Furnix.png). In Japanese, its name is „Éí„Éâ„É™„Éº (Hidorƒ´) - Fire Bird. Hidorƒ´ is a corruption of a portmanteau of ÁÅ´ (Hi) and È≥• (Tori). Fi says this about Furnix:

&gt;**This spirit bird is said to survive by eating flames**. Due to its cautious nature, it can be difficult to approach.

This spirit bird connected to fire is obviously a reference to the legendary phoenix. The phoenix is a famous symbol of rebirth. 

I find it interesting that in the underground section of the Ancient Cistern there are Fire Keese. Why not Dark Keese, which can curse Link? They would fit right in with the cursed nature of the underground section, and its enemies. Perhaps the Fire Keese below mirror the Furnix above. Maybe these spirits and demons of fire illustrate the cycle of rebirth, as the purification or corruption of their soul dictates the realm they are reborn into. 

The cycle of rebirth in Buddhism also reminds us of the Curse of Hatred pronounced by Demise at the end of SS. This particular cycle continues to plague the world up to the time of BotW. It's unknown whether this cycle can be broken, or if it is eternal. 

**Full Circle** 

In conclusion, what was the ultimate goal of the ancient humans, as shown by the Ancient Cistern temple?

It was the same goal they've always had since first meeting the Goddess Hylia. The goal symbolised by the Leaf turning into the Bird. It was to head skyward, to reach for the heavens. It started with the accumulation of knowledge, wisdom and power. Their expansion into the world taught them many things. They reached the height of technology and science. But, they still had room to grow. Spiritually.

The mechanical function of the Ancient Cistern was to purify water and store it. They weren't filtering the relatively clean water of Lake Floria so they could drink it. They were filtering it to create their own version of Sacred Water. This wasn't true Sacred Water, but this cleansed water was no doubt used by the ancient humans in their purification rituals. 

It's no coincidence that the Flame of Farore, the Flame of Courage, is kept in the Ancient Cistern temple. That temple is all about purifying the soul, and strengthening it. And, what is Courage but a strong soul? What is a purified soul, one which is full of gratitude, but a soul full of sacred energy, full of Life? Truly, a worthy home for Farore's Flame.

The ancient humans wanted to grow spiritually, and in doing so they would reach enlightenment. They would ascend. 

Exactly how they would ascend, and which humans would succeed in doing so, will be discussed in the final entry in this series. 

**An Apology**

First of all, apologies to anyone who has been waiting for the next part of this series for a while. I completely underestimated how long and involved this particular entry would be. It's kind of hilarious that I said at the end of the previous entry that this one would be shorter.

Also, I've tried to make this as clear to follow as possible, while remaining thorough. The length meant I was forced to split up this post anyway, but it was easier to split into three parts than two. (something something timeline splits)

I apologise too if this entry is a bit too esoteric, compared to previous entries. There's a lot of discussion about religious beliefs and concepts that may feel out of place in a Zelda discussion. However, I hope that I've made the connections between these ideas and the SS lore clear. These may not be things normally discussed in Zelda, but SS is a more deeper game lore-wise than previous entries. You just have to be willing to dig a little. 

Finally, an apology to anyone looking for a tl;dr. There isn't one.

Looking forward to finishing this series with the next entry. I'm 99% sure that it will be as short as the first few entries, and arrive a lot sooner. Here's hoping!

Are you still with me? Good, because we can now finally tackle the Ancient Cistern itself. 

Who constructed the Ancient Cistern, and why did they do so?

If you've read any of the previous entries in this series, then the answer to the first part of the question should be obvious. It was the ancient humans. But, what proof do we have for this?

First of all, the symbol of a flowering plant carved on the [doors of the Ancient Cistern]( https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14/Walkthrough/10/1004.jpg), is the same symbol found on the [doors of the Skyview Temple]( https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14/Walkthrough/03/0311.jpg). Secondly, there is a Crystal Switch found in the underground section of the temple. This technology is also found in the Skyview Temple, and the Lanayru Province. Both of these points highlight that the Ancient Cistern must have been built by the same people who built the Skyview Temple.

We also need to consider the guardian put in place to protect the Ancient Cistern ‚Äì Koloktos.

&gt;Target lock: Koloktos

&gt;This ""**Ancient Automaton**"" defends the Ancient Cistern and eliminates intruders.

&gt;- Fi 

Koloktos is an ancient automaton. An ancient robot. That technology was developed by the ancient humans in the Lanayru Province, as we discussed in the last entry. 

So, it's reasonable to believe that the ancient humans built the Ancient Cistern, probably at a much later date than the Skyview Temple. The technology found in the Ancient Cistern is much more complex than that found in the Skyview Temple. 

The Ancient Cistern even reflects some of the architecture found in the Eldin Province. I will discuss them in detail later on, but typically Buddhist symbols like the Dharma Wheel, and the Sacred Lotus Flower, which can be found in the Earth Temple, are even more prominent in the Ancient Cistern. The Earth Temple was also distinctive in its large images of beasts and deities. Again, we see this reflected in the [entrance to the Ancient Cistern](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/5467215_orig.jpg). A large fish, very likely representing a water spirit or deity, is fitting in its connection to a temple focused on the Element of Water. It's no different to the statues and images of dragons, elephants, and salamanders, found in the Earth Temple, representing spirits and gods of Earth and Fire. (Interestingly, a similarly shaped large statue of a fish can be found on top of [Zora's Domain](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/f/f5/BotW_Zora%27s_Domain.png?version=4fc9d049b4a06494e02734ff242427be) in BotW. It's likely an image of Lord Jabu-Jabu, or a related Guardian Deity of the Zora. Could the statue forming the entrance to the Ancient Cistern be of a similar Guardian Spirit?)

So, in some ways the Ancient Cistern is a culmination of everything the ancient humans have learned in their journey, as laid out in the previous entries in this series. Things they learned from their birthplace in the Faron Woods, to the Eldin Volcano, and to the Lanayru Province. That journey took the ancient humans to extraordinary heights, both technologically and materially. The Goddess Hylia had turned their gaze skyward, but to truly reach the heavens, the ancient humans would have to grow spiritually. To do so, they go full circle and come back to where they started, the Faron Woods, and to the source of life - Water.

**Temple of Gratitude**

What is the purpose of the Ancient Cistern? Why did the ancient humans build it? Just to purify water? 

The key to the Ancient Cistern is Gratitude. [Literally](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/3/3a/Blessed_Idol.png/revision/latest?cb=20120126225643). The Blessed Idol is the key used to reach Farore's Flame. In Japanese its name is „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Åü„ÅÑÂÉè (Arigatai Zou), Grateful/Thankful Image. „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Åü„ÅÑ can also mean evoking gratitude. It's interesting then to note its in-game description:

&gt;You got the Blessed Idol!

&gt;This carved wooden statue looks like **it's supposed to inspire gratitude**. It also **looks like the stone statue on the upper floor**.

The Blessed Idol is a miniature of the large stone statue in the Ancient Cistern. Remember all the way back at the beginning of this post when I asked why the statue looks like Buddha. Well, now we start to understand what it really represents and means in the world of SS. **It's supposed to inspire gratitude**.

This isn't the only time gratitude is mentioned in connection with the Ancient Cistern. On a stone tablet in front of the large statue, the following message is engraved:

&gt;Carved into the great statue are **inscriptions of gratitude**. They reveal the secret order of **this temple**.

&gt;First the back, then the rear, then the back of the right palm, and finally the back of the left palm.

The great statue has inscriptions of gratitude carved into it. Also, note that while Fi described the Ancient Cistern as a facility for purifying water, it is also a temple. To the ancient humans, this wasn't just a secular building like the Lanayru Mining Facility, it was a spiritual place.

One of these inscriptions of gratitude can be seen [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/3428411_orig.jpg), carved on the back of the great statue. It's clearly another representation of the sacred lotus flower, which can be found EVERYWHERE in the Ancient Cistern. How many more times can you see a lotus flower just in that image?

If the spiritual purpose of the temple was to inspire gratitude, why was its function to purify water? What's the connection between the two? And, why were the ancient humans interested in inspiring gratitude?

**The Grateful Demon**

Thankfully, SS tells us more about Gratitude and its connection to purification, and it does so through the demon Batreaux.

Batreaux is a kind-hearted [demon](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/4/42/AlienBatreaux.png?version=4507b8cb5828203fecaf8290554922b8), living on Skyloft, who wants to become a [human](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/3/32/HumanBatreaux.png?version=b4bc56e0cd90a98ad7ea8f2e5bc34d97). When Link first meets him, Batreaux tells him a tale about the ancient humans...

&gt;You see, there is **an old tale among my monstrous kin** that goes as follows...

&gt;It seems that **when humans make other humans happy, the happy humans produce a substance known as a Gratitude Crystal**.

&gt;Gratitude Crystals are quite amazing! **Just looking at them and knowing there was such gratitude in the world could turn me from a monster into a human**!

Batreaux and his demonic kin invaded the Surface world towards the end of the Era of the Goddess Hylia. They learned that the humans living at that time could produce Gratitude Crystals by making other humans happy. In Japanese they are called ÊÑüË¨ù„ÅÆÊ∞óÊåÅ„Å° (Kansha no Kimochi) - Feelings of Gratitude. The in-game description says:

&gt;These form when a person is so completely overwhelmed with feelings of thankfulness that crystallized gratitude is created.

It seems that just looking at them has the power to transform Batreaux into a human, though it takes a lot of them to do so. But, is that really what causes him to transform? Notice some of the expressions Batreaux makes to Link as you continue to help him:

&gt;Any help you can provide **will be dearly appreciated**. I promise your assistance will **not go unrewarded**!

&gt;Please take this as a token of **this demon's deepest appreciation**!

&gt;This is **such an appallingly insufficient reward that my cheeks burn hot with embarrassment, but please...take this**!

&gt;**But that's not all I want you to have**. Goodness, no. **I have so much more thanks to give! Here, take this too**!

&gt;If I'm not mistaken, that's all the Gratitude Crystals in the whole wonderful world! **Thank you! Thank you ever so much!** Please accept this final gift with **all of my gratitude**.

&gt;Allow me to tell you this...**there's simply no word in your language to describe how grateful I am for your help. I am deeply touched!** From now on, I plan to live happily with everyone else. Not as a monster... but as any other person.

&gt;This is **an embarrassingly small token of my gratitude**, but I hope it will be useful to you.

Do you see why Batreaux transformed into a human? It wasn't just because he looked at some Gratitude Crystals. While there was certainly power in the crystals themselves that aided the transformation, I think that it was a more involved process than that.  **Batreaux became overwhelmed with gratitude himself**. He was so grateful that Link was helping him, a demon, that he became full of positive emotions. Positive energy. Demons are full of Malice. Negative energy. Negative emotions like hatred and envy. In true Shinto style, this kami was pacified. The energy fueling him transformed from negative into positive, and thus he was no longer a demon. Of course, it helped that Batreaux already had a kind heart to begin with. Most demons do not.

You could say that Batreaux was purified. Notice what he says about the effect he used to have on Skyloft when he was a demon:

&gt;There's no denying that **when I was a demon, I must have radiated a fiendish power into my surroundings**. Now that I'm human, it seems **that most-unpleasant aura has completely faded from this place, like an odious aroma in the wind**!

Yes, his demonic power was like a form of pollution. His impurity was affecting all life in the area. By purifying Batreaux, Skyloft is cleansed as well.

**Cultural Habits**

That's all good for Batreaux, but what does this have to do with the ancient humans, and the Ancient Cistern? Well, let's look at one more thing that Batreaux tells Link about the Gratitude Crystals:

&gt;I'm sure **someone with a heart as pure and genuine as yours will be able to see them**.

Not every human can see them. Because Link's heart is **pure**, he is one of the few who can. None of the people he helps notice the Gratitude Crystals that they produce. Of course, I'm sure that none of us would say that any of the inhabitants of Skyloft have an evil heart, but are their hearts completely pure?

I believe that this is the key to why the ancient humans built the Ancient Cistern. They wanted to purify their hearts and grow spiritually. 

We already know from Batreaux's old tale that the ancient humans were interested in creating Gratitude Crystals by making each other happy. However, only those with a pure heart would have been able to see them. This was so important, and ingrained in them, that traces of it can still be found on Skyloft. 

&gt;Oh! **Thank you so much! I owe you a lifetime of gratitude for this!** To say thank you, I'll sell you one item from my shop at half off, so please stop by again!

&gt;- Beedle

&gt;Thank you so much! I don't have much to give you to repay you, but **please take this with my gratitude**!

&gt;- Parrow

&gt;Kukiel is safely back at home, and it's all because of you! **I don't know how to express my gratitude**.

&gt;- Wryna

&gt;Yesssss... No doubt **you can see the gratitude in my eyes**!

&gt;Fates and fortunes! My eyes are wide with the thrill of possibility and **damp with tears of gratitude**!

&gt;- Sparrot

Now, you could see these as just the expressions of people overwhelmed with gratitude, but could it also be the left over traces of a culture that was obsessed with gratitude? There's something very formal about the way they declare it. Why, even the Ancient Robots were programmed to express it!

&gt;Hmmm. Are you sure it was him, grrzt? ...Well then, **I extend my reluctant thanks to you in a gesture of obligatory gratitude**, vrrrrrrt-CHONK.

&gt;- Scrapper

Is this just programmed civility, or a reflection of their creators' values?

Even if you're not convinced that these are the lingering traces of an ancient culture, there's no denying that the ancient humans were preoccupied with gratitude and purifying their hearts, as shown by the Ancient Cistern, and Batreaux's tale. 

Note too how Demise describes the humans living at the end of the Era of the Goddess Hylia:

&gt;How curious... **The humans I've known were weak things**. Hardly more than insects, shivering under rocks and ready to flee at a mere glimpse of me. 

&gt;When last I walked this world, **they did little more than scream and cling to their goddess, mewling and praying**... Counting on her to protect them. How amusing to think **those cowards** begot someone like you.

&gt;You grow more fascinating by the second, human. I never imagined I'd meet one of your kind who wished to stand against me in battle.

From Demise's point of view, the ancient humans were cowards. Weak things who could only pray or run away. Now, we know that humans, even those in the Zelda universe, are capable of more than that. Not every human is a Hero like Link, but neither are they all cowards. Humans run the gamut of personality types and traits. 

But, what if an entire culture had become devoted to becoming pure of heart? To completely removing anything viewed as impure or negative, both externally and internally? What if the great statue in the Ancient Cistern represented their view of the ideal human? Someone completely pure and full of gratitude. 

Then it's possible that that culture would be completely unequipped to deal with a large-scale demonic invasion. There would be no warriors, no one to fight back. Living under the rule of the Goddess Hylia would have been a virtual paradise. All of the races would have lived together in peace. There had been no wars since the beginning of creation.

Now, when Demise invaded, Hylia learned to fight, and so did the other races. But, not the humans. They had to be protected. To be made safe. Why couldn't they learn just like everyone else? Well, maybe it was because Hylia was playing favourites, and maybe it was because of their culture.

truezelda,t3_beteh3,Do you think the schedule system from Majora's Mask should return?,"In my opinion, the schedule system is great because it provides much needed life to the world of Zelda and makes the NPCs far more alive by making them act as actual people. A similar version of this can be seen in BotW however it is, to my knowledge, only found in Kakariko Village and is very simple compared to Majora's Mask.

Of course I'm not expecting every NPC to be just as in-depth in their AI as Majora's Mask but I think a rudimentary schedule system for unimportant NPCs while elaborate ones for key NPCs could be manageable.

There will be adjustments to be made; an open world game obviously requires a different system than a game which ends after 3 days. So, instead of a three day schedule, we should have a 7 day week. The week would also loop too (but schedules can be adjusted for special events).

truezelda,t3_bew4f2,[Ideas] Ganondorf‚Äôs daughter?,"Basically a rehash of Midna with added Gerudo elements, courser personality, and daddy issues or conflict. Maybe she could start off as a companion character and be secretly working against link only to turn a new leaf, possibly eliciting the ‚Äúi am not my father‚Äù trope. Maybe she can turn against her dad in some climactic scene that possibly results in her death evoking more of an emotional response and sense of urgency from the player. How do you feel about this idea? Should it or something similar be implemented in a game or remain in fanfic lmao? Similarly how would you like to see moral complexity represented in Zelda games? Better if not even agreeable motivations for villains? Better redemption arcs for said villains or morally ambiguous characters? What narrative tropes would you like to see subverted or explored in this sense?

*Edit*:
Mind you it doesn‚Äôt necessarily *have* to be Ganondorf. I would just like Nintendo to explore character development for villains along the lines of ‚ÄúI am not my environment/fate/family etc.‚Äù Villains that question their own motivations, villains with personal motivations that go beyond ‚Äúpower for power‚Äôs sake‚Äù. A Zelda that glorifies free will and personal agency as one of its themes. In no way would i want these themes to be heavy-handed or cliched, but simply serve as a interesting development in the story. I feel like they brisked this idea ever so slightly via dialogue (Midna being a descendent of the interlopers in TP, Ganondorf implying he initially wanted to rule Hyrule for the benefit of his people at the end of WW). I think they should execute this the same way, just making it slightly more pertinent to the story. I really just thought of the daughter thing as platform for these ideas.",0,public,,0

truezelda,t3_be0v5g,Should Rauru be retconned as a Rito?,"The avian Rito people are severely underrepresented in the Zelda series. They don‚Äôt even appear in most Zelda titles, and usually only play a somewhat minor role in the story when they do. Breath of the Wild does a lot to expand upon their culture (as well as retconning their look to be more birdlike), and it really makes me want them to be in more things. The Four Champions in BotW got me thinking back to the Seven Sages from Ocarina of Time, where I realized something tragic: every major race in Hyrule has one of its members as a Sage- except the Rito. There‚Äôs Saria representing the Kokiri, Darunia for the Gorons, Naboru for the Gerudo, Ruta for the Zora, Impa for the Sheikah... but no Rito. Just two Hylians in the form of Zelda and Rauru. This got me thinking: should Rauru be retconned to be a Rito? It would allow all the races to be represented in the Sages, and give representation to the Rito in a game where they‚Äôre otherwise absent. Plus Rauru would make the most sense, since we already know he can take the form of a bird in Kaebora Gaebora. What do you all think? Is this a good idea?",14,public,,0

Are there any big changes like that you‚Äôd like to see made to the personality or physical appearance of the next incarnation of Link?

Personally, Link‚Äôs appearance in ALttP (in game, at least) and Triforce Heroes has got me thinking about what Link would look like with a hair color other than light brown or blonde. I think it would be interesting to see how he could pull off dark brown or black hair, just to name an example. I am personally not a fan of the less expressive Links in the series, so I would love to see the next Link have even more dialogue options than in Breath of The Wild.

A train/bus system to get from each town/city that is just a cutscene. 
That would help Nintendo be able to focus more toward each city and town. 

Modern and classic customization for outfits. Giving the classic Link outfit a modern twist while also giving us an option to wear the proper getup. That way he actually gets to look like he belongs in the world and doesnt stick out like a sore thumb in his normal attire.

truezelda,t3_bczcpw,Idea for Fast Travel in an Adult Timeline Game,"So the other day I was playing BotW when I realized how easy to exploit and use the fast travel system was. While the intended goal was to make sure that players couldn't rely on fast travel for a majority of exploration but it failed in that regard; mostly due to the paraglider which can take advantage of the height of the towers to travel large distances across the world. The end result is that extensive use of fast travel is still an issue (it may be even worse than other titles if you consider paragliding fast travel). 

**Part 1: Paraglider Peculiarities**

So how do we solve this problem? First, you don't give the paraglider to the player immediately after the tutorial. The paraglider and climbing are the two biggest enemies to exploration in this game. However some kind of safety net is needed to prevent falling from being too punishing. So, instead, you get the sailcloth. This means that initially gliding will only be used as a life jacket from fall damage. 

But don't worry, the paraglider isn't going nowhere. It's just the Level 2 version of the sailcloth because this time around there's item progression. The paraglider would be obtained mid-game or late mid-game.

So what is at the end of this progression path. Well, Level 3 is just pure, unadulterated flying. That's right, the final progression path of the sailcloth let's you become Superman (in more ways than one actually)! 

The item itself is the Roc's Cape and would be obtained late endgame. I say late endgame because of how OP and gamebreaking it would be. The only time the Roc's Cape should be used is for finishing up side quests or doing bonus content and DLC. It would also make the player feel like a badass for reasons I'll get into in the next part.

In regards to climbing I wouldn't nerf it apart from some minor limitations such as preventing you from eating while climbing or pausing stamina loss if youre standing still. Instead, I would simply make climbing have a lot more going on than it does in BotW. 

**Part 2: Public Transporation**

To replace towers instead we'll add public transportation or, in other words, trains! A big issue with BotW towers is that they're towers and thus good places to scout the area or glide from. Furthermore, towers are very exploitable for fast travel use and don't fulfill their intended purpose.

To solve this (and this is the reason its specifically for the Adult Timeline) we replace towers with a transit system that takes you to different stations around the map usually in major cities or notable towns.

Why is this better than towers? For starters,  they aren't towers so you can't freely scout the region for notable landmarks although there could be a cutscene within the train that gives you a window (literally) into what the region has to offer. Thus, you need to actually explore in order to progress.

Secondly, you need to pay to ride the train so you can't just teleport to wherever you need to go to with no repercussions unless you're fine with wasting loads of rupees. On a side note I had a idea that you would have to buy a ticket to ride the train. If you didn't have the money or just don't want to waste your rupees, you could pickpocket someone to take theirs. Either way, there will be consequences for fast travel.

Third, the trains can only take you so far. The trains would only go to major civilian areas such as cities or notable towns not dungeons or temples. Some trains can't even cross over to different regions because it's not in their jurisdiction to do so. 

Fourth, trains are not always accessible. There would be a schedule for the trains (which the player can view at the train station) so if you miss your train to Castle Town for instance you're out of luck and either have to go there yourself or wait for the next train. This encourages players to think about where they want to go and plan it out.

This can also extend to other forms of transportation. Airships can be freely flown by the player and reach otherwise remote places but, due to their size, can only land in specific areas. Boats can be used to more easily navigate bodies of water but can't be used outside of water. Heck, if cities are big enough, trams may be a good form of transportation to get you from district to district. 

This also ties into my earlier statement about the Roc's Cape. I predict that flying would be impactful to players because now you have a frame of reference to compare it with. At the beginning of the game you were taking the train like everyone else and now look at you; you're flying!

So what are your thoughts? Do you agree or disagree?",14,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bct2u8,[ALBW] Is there any significance to Ravio's name?,"As we know, Hyrule and Lorule are essentially mirror images of each other, and as such, the people of Hyrule have their Lorulean counterparts (i.e. they look similar, but have different names).

Some speculate that the name ""Hilda"" was chosen for Zelda's counterpart because they sound similar, while others have been quick to point out that Zelda and Hilda were the names of the two aunts in the popular TV show ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch.""

truezelda,t3_bcnkoq,The boundaries between regions in Breath of the Wild,"What determines the boundaries between regions in Breath of the Wild. I noticed before I went to all the towers, and can see on the maps in the link below, difficulty in determining why the boundaries are drawn like they are. Though in a lot of cases, there are natural landmarks and boundaries (like mountain cliffs and rivers) that divide regions, the boundaries between regions sometimes seem to take winding paths over terrain that has no natural boundary. Here are the maps showing the regional boundaries:

Mario is Nintendo‚Äôs mascot so he‚Äôs not leaving anytime soon, and Pok√©mon is a world wide phenomenon at this point, but Zelda ( despite haven issues with it) does have an overreaching premise. Will Nintendo ever end the series then reboot after a certain time, if so what would be the reaction from fans, and would investors even allow them to?",7,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bcjty5,Zelda and the Illuminati Conspiracy,"Before I say anything, just know that I am a Christian guy of 15 years of age, fairly new to Christ. Now that you know my background, also please let me say that I think the Illuminati rumors are very interesting, and also extremely frightening. I believe in all of the prophecies in Revelation, and I think the ""Illuminati"" may play a part in it, but a group, such as Bilderburg, may be a more likely threat than this secret group many people fantasize about.I'm not sure if this secret group is real, but the occultist imagery definitely is. Now, i would like to point out that there is a TON of symbolism in Zelda. In Ocarina of time, you have the triforce mark on the hands (On Ganondorf it is on right, on Like it is on Left, 666 is a perfect square). If you find the only two names which are repeated, you will find ""Lon Lon Ranch"", and"" Lord Jabu Jabu"". The supposed anti-God of the masons is named Jabulon... The temple of time is a Freemason's playground. The checkered floors, golden furniture, Triforce marks, Sun idols, and red carpets are all found here. There are also many hidden Islamic references in the game as well. The infamous Islamic chanting of the fire temple (which was removed in the North American release) was present. The movable blocks have a moon and star, much like many Mosques have. Also, if you look up the word ""Shiek,"" you will find out that it means an Islamic leader in Arabic, with ""Shiekah"" meaning the same thing but in feminine form. Evil/ all seeing eyes are also found in the game. 


From this we can pretty much say that Zelda does, in fact, have occultic symbols in it. (If your not convinced, please watch this.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnxQzHv14zs&amp;list=PLFGRMWMkPDHWQJaq7uTkippUwvc3uAiOF) So now, we have to decide, since Nintendo is awakened, which side are they on? There is evidence for both sides, but I would have to say they are against the Illuminati. First off, Zelda was originally meant to be a Christian game. By that i mean that the religion of Hyrule was Christianity. This is proven by the inclusion of the Bible in the Japanese version of the original Zelda, the cross on Links shield, and a picture of Link praying by a cross (with Jesus on it) in the ""a Link to The Past"" guidebook. Furthermore, I believe that Link represents Jesus. You could also say that Link represents the anti-Christ, as he attempts to mimic the life of Jesus, but then why would he be praying to a cross? And why would he be battling Ganon, who obviously represents Satan. You can also see that whenever a Evil/all seeing eye is placed in a Zelda game, it is meant to be ominous, not to convince the public to trust the Illuminati. For example, when you get the mask of truth from the Happy mask salesman, everyone avoids you because they are afraid of it. Navi and Tatl also say that the stones with the eyes on them (suddenly forgot the names) look creepy. Why would the Illuminati try to scare you away? They wouldn't. Many enemies only have one eye, such as Bongo Bongo. Also, if you watch the series i posted above until episode 6, you will see that the enemy from Twilight princess (don't know his name yet, I just started playing the game :D) is a sun worshiper. He said that he looked to the heavens (up) and found a god. After you defeat him, you see him bowing down and being enveloped by a yellowish orange ball of energy, which is very likely the sun. That is why he wanted to bring darkness. Also, if 666 is a perfect equilateral triangle, why is link the only one to have the Triforce mark it on his left hand (with the exclusion of wii titles to match the game play of players.), while Link and Zelda have it on their right hands? That's about all i know for now. If you have any more information, or any personal opinions, i would love to hear them. Thanks for reading, and God Bless!",0,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bc7s4g,What would be your thoughts on Link being reincarnated inti another race such as a Gerudo or Zora?,"I would personally find it fascinating and enjoyable to see the gameplay differences and structure of the story if Link was a different race. 

Gerudo Link would certainly be the most interesting story-wise in my opinion since it would subvert one of the many common tropes of Zelda. Meanwhile, Zora/Rito would be more interesting gameplay wise and I would be excited to see how Nintendo would design a game to accommodate flying and swimming as one of the major forms of movement the player is going to be using.

She's not that tall anyways and Zidon is huge so maybe that's why, but Zidon is also over 100 when we meet him so maybe they grow up very slowly? Well, yes and no. After a side quest (special delivery? idk) a tiny Zora says she's old enough to get married, so Mipha was way older than 18 by the time she met Link, but how old? 30? 40? 50?!

truezelda,t3_bbwg5n,The meaning of the color pink in Sheikah technology (spoilers),"One of the most common sights of Sheikah technology you see in BOTW is the Guardian Stalker, which lights up pink when it spots you, though before it was corrupted by Ganon it lit up orange instead (as could be seen in one of the memories). So what exactly does the pink signify? Does it simply mean corruption by Ganon, or perhaps malfunctioning?

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the other Sheikah technology that lights up pink, there's the Divine Beasts while they're under Ganon's control. But what's interesting is that its lights are still pink after beating the Blight Ganon hijacking it and before you turn on the main program. After the main program turns on, the Divine Beast lights up blue instead. What's interesting is how you have to reactivate all the consoles as part of retaking each Divine Beast. It's like the Blight Ganon shut off a lot of the programs when it took over, including the main program, so the pink here could signify malfunctioning.

&amp;#x200B;

The pillars surrounding Hyrule Castle light up pink throughout the game. In fact, they were already lit up pink when they were emerging from the ground after Calamity Ganon arose. However, after beating Dark Beast Ganon, when Zelda talks to you, they're now lighting up blue. (And then, by the time of the true ending, they've shut off completely.)

&amp;#x200B;

So it looks like the pink either indicates Ganon's corruption, or malfunctioning. It's interesting how this game makes the color pink seem sinister!",55,public,,0
truezelda,t3_bbn0oh,BOTW - Stealth Mechanics,"A lot of people felt like BOTW fell short in a lot of areas. I think one aspect I think was glanced over, might've been the stealth mechanics that you could employ.  You can sneak up behind an enemy and stab them in the back while undetected. You could sneak into a camp while everyone is asleep. But beyond that, I don't think you could get that creative with stealth. Maybe it's just the massive amount of Dishonored that I have been playing that makes me think about stealth so much and the creativity in that game.  

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me want to use more stealth options in the game. Drop Assassinations would be an option where you jump off from a higher point and automatically take an enemy out once you hit the ground, no fall damage.   More noise makers would be useful to just go in and grab the treasure would be useful to distract enemies.  I also felt like even when I did sneak up on enemies and stab them in the back, as the enemies got higher hp, it was no longer one hit kills, which kills the stealthy immersion.

truezelda,t3_bbe574,Rethinking the Timeline placement for BotW: Devil's Advocate,"I know that many people--myself included-- believe in a DT placement. However, I think it's gotten to the point where we have closed our minds off to other arguments, and refuse to see any other placements. Here are some arguments to get you thinking as an exercise:

-Hylians are extinct on the DT.

In ALttP, Hylians are recorded as being an ancient race that is long extinct.  Even the Historia refers to this on page 93:

''However, the kingdom fell into ruin during the Imprisoning War, and the bloodline of the Hylians weakened with the ages, until their existence was naught by a thing of the past.'' 

This fact along with the fact that there are still pointy eared humans means that Hylians are not synonymous with pointy eared humans as we believe. The Hylian culture is gone in ALttP, and the term, ''Hylian'' is never used to refer to any humans in LA, OoX, ALBW, TFH, LoZ or AoL. The only timeline to have Hylians is the CT.

-Tradition vs Law

While the backstory for AoL makes it clear that it was made law that every princess would be named Zelda. However in TWW, when Tetra is revealed by Daphnes to be a princess, he immediately calls her ''Princess Zelda'' not ''Princess Tetra'', even telling her that she must follow the ancient law of the past right before doing so. This makes it clear that a similar law was decreed in the AT before the Great Flood.

With that being said, however, Rhoam's entry has him saying that he followed the traditions of the RF and DECIDED to name her Zelda, implying that it's his choice, something it wouldn't be if there was a law.  


-The curious case of the OoT sages.

People say that BotW isn't on the CT because the OoT sages are mentioned in BotW and HH says that the HoT was forgotten. However, MM says in the intro that the story of the HoT is held dearly by the RF. MM3D says the same thing and that remake was released after HH, superseding it in terms of canoncity. This means it's possible for the OoT sages to be remembered in all three timelines in current canon. 

I used to be a hardcore DTer, but recently, I've been considering counterpoints I haven't heard before that have me thinking. I think that any of the three timelines are possible now even if I prefer a DT placement still. Hell, even ''Hyrule being erased'' can be explained by either: Daphnes dying at the end of TWW reversing his wish on the Triforce before it's fully complete(it's mentioned that the Triforce will grant the wishes of the one who touches it, as long they live), or someone discovering legends of Old Hyrule,(which we know exists thanks to the Ruto Crown in ST) and finding the Triforce and wishing on it to unerase Hyrule. Yes, speculative, which is why it's the least likely, but still possible.",37,public,,0

truezelda,t3_bau2fm,Would it be of interest if we at least saw attempts to break the reincarnation cycle by the main trio of characters?,"like, a point in time where all three find ways and make attempts to break the cycle. 

- link being reluctant in his destiny and openly questioning his path. Coming to the inescapable conclusion that future reincarnations of Himself will be doing essentially the same thing forever and then attempting to rebel against the will of the Goddesses as there is no point in becoming the chosen hero if your work will just be undone over and over again. Even going so far as to refuse to pull out the master sword or even throwing down the master sword before ganon. knowing full on well the pointlessness of having your work undone and having to do the same thing over and over again.

- Zelda or any other reincarnation of Hylia discovering a repeating pattern in past tales of the hero and becoming aware of the cycle as well as coming to the conclusion that this cycle must not continue and that Hyrule must not suffer over and over again through it for eternity. Also wondering if Hylia or the Goddesses would really want to let this land suffer for eternity. A mention of the Great calamity from BOTW would lead her to this conclusion that it definitely *needs* to stop as each cycle causing hyrule's torment to get more and more worse.

- The Gerudo male prior to becoming Ganon's host hearing of Demise's curse and how ganon and the other past evils is tied to it. When confronting ganon in his subconscious, he tries to reason with the ancient evil of the meaninglessness and futility of the curse and how he will always fail in the end. Telling him it needs to stop and that he and any potential reincarnations don't want to be ""you"" anymore. Actively fighting Ganon's influence on him while doing so.

Like, it would really be something if there was a future game that questioned the concept of destiny and introduced the concept of free will. Though this seemingly means the Goddesses are the real villains, assuming Ganon/Demise also becomes aware of the pointlessness of the curse.

Though i can imagine one such attempt being mentioned in dialogue or written text in a game, like link hearing a story of a previous cycle of how after defeating the ancient evil, the hero unexpectedly turned his blade on the princess and then on himself. the truth would later reveal that this incarnation of the hero became aware of the never ending cycle and tried to break the cycle by killing princess and himself after slaying the evil.

truezelda,t3_b8s21z,Combat needs to be less reactive and more proactive,"This is a trend I've noticed among the 3D Zelda games. Some people complain that Zelda combat is overly dependent on finding an enemy's weak point and attacking it, but I think the real term for that is the combat being overly *reactive* rather than *proactive*.

Most of the ""advanced"" combat moves throughout the 3D games have been more reactive rather than proactive. The ""parry"" in Wind Waker can only be done in response to an enemy attack. Skyward Sword's swordplay can only be done in reaction to the directional weakness that an enemy displays at the time, with the only exceptions being a select few fodder enemies; the only way around that is to parry, which itself is also reactive. Breath of the Wild rebalances this significantly by having the physics and chemistry system to get around wooden and electric shields, but two of the most efficient tactics are Flurry Rushing for most enemies, and parrying for Guardians, both of which are reactive.

I think at least some of these moves can be reworked to be a bit more proactive rather than just reactive. Although I want directional swordplay to return in its classic ""down, left, right, stab"" form, I've come to agree that it's not exactly a good idea to build a whole combat system around it and that it's best left as an ""extra control for flavor"" deal. Maybe have a few enemies that take advantage of it like Shellblades, or do a Morrowind deal and have different directions deal damage for different weapons. Also go back to having the sword moves from Wind Waker be done at will, though I'll get to that later.

The problem with combat being overly reactive is how enemies control the pace of the fight too much. Quite a bit of enemies in Wind Waker and Skyward Sword have impenetrable or at least annoying defenses until you react to their attacks, and that just takes the game out of the player's hands. As an interactive medium, all video games need some type of agency, whether it be the choice to explore the world at their own discretion to controlling the pace of a fight. While some reactive elements are interesting, having reaction be overly emphasized is just not satisfying design.

That said, I think there is a thing as being too proactive, at least in a sense. Twilight Princess has a whole bunch of sword moves that you can do, but because enemies rarely have any type of defense, the moves are rather unrewarding since they can't do much more than the standard attack string can already do. As I said before, we need reactive elements to give reason to use abilities, just not so much that the game is dominated by such.

What we need is a better balance. Breath of the Wild gets close by allowing you to deal some damage even though enemies have a tendency to armor through your moves if you don't do a Flurry Rush or Parry. But I still think there is more they can do by having aggressive strategies be rewarded on enemies that aren't red Bokoblins. Maybe have some enemies you can aggro through with no armor, while other enemies that have super armor that encourages more reactive playstyles; this gives it variety. Of course, this has to be coupled with moves that you can do at your own leisure either to get around defenses or for style points, and not just reacting to enemy attacks.",14,public,,0

truezelda,t3_b7tgpe,Some results from the Legend of Zelda Consumer Experience Survey,"So a couple weeks ago (at the end of my spring break), I put out a Qualtrics survey asking for data regarding how players would score each of the Zelda games they've played, overall and across six categories.  You can find the original thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/b1kfy8/i_made_a_survey_to_study_trends_in_consumer/

My ambitions were to gather data in a format that was filterable for multiple queries. There were over 200 complete responses and around 200 more partial responses. I waited an extra week before closing partial responses. I'm due to put out an update, so let me give a quick run down of what I have and have not analyzed (yet):

**Online Community sources**: Roughly half of the responses skipped this question, roughly half mentioned reddit in general or multiple subreddits. Very few folks mentioned other sites.  I decided not to pursue any sort of community-source analysis, but at least I have the general idea that most responses are from a reddit audience.

**Games vs Extent Played** Out of 374 total responses. Because this question came before the score questions, the score questions have even fewer responses than listed below.

[Games vs Extent Played](https://i.imgur.com/3cdXdI1.png)


**Different Versions of the Same Game**: I left it up to the player to decide how to score a title if they've played multiple versions of it (average impression or best impression, etc). I thought it might be possible to compare responses of one version against another, but that puts up the player-to-player score variation that I'll get into later. For now, I've ignored this data and left all versions combined as one title, but can come back to it.

[Album of simple Breakdowns](https://imgur.com/a/xZ1Hdpc)
These simple breakdowns from Qualtrics ignore that many people have played multiple versions of the same game, so I may go back and do a more detailed breakdown in Excel.

**Game vs Game Overall:** One of things I'd like to do with this data is, for the response rows where a player has played/beaten and scored two games, plot the score of one game versus the other, and look at the regression trends. This is ongoing.  The biggest challenge with this direction of analysis is that by construction, there will almost always be a strong 1:1 trend based on two contributing factors: a) each respondent used their own 0-100 scale for scoring games, so what is high or low for one person is not the same as for another person, and b) some folks like Zelda games in general more or less than others.  I'll try to make a 19x18/2 table showing each pair of games with their trendline correlation coefficients, which should show games that divide fans, probably poorly. 

**Survey vs Critics Overall:** I'm nowhere near looking at critic data yet.

**Overall vs Category:** I thought I might see if there was a way to determine which categories most closely correlate to overall scores, across the series and by game. I'll first try least-squares on a linear combination of categories to determine weight coefficients. I'm not expecting spectacular results here, so any other ideas on this part welcome. There was a lot of feedback on the categories being broad or poorly grouped, which is fair - I had decided to narrow down the Zelda experience to just 6 categories for survey purposes, which is not the most accurate at all. Some categories don't apply [the same] to all games.  It's something. 

**The Fun Part:** If you are familiar with PivotTables (I am) or SQL (I am not), then you are probably familiar with the idea that a database can be sorted and filtered based on queries to generate results.  If not, then I'll sum up the idea here: rather than taking all data from each question and generating an average and comparing averages, we can specify which types of responses to look at first, then run a calculation on those responses. This addresses two big points - a) when someone has played but not beaten a game, we can choose whether or not to include that data, and b) We can narrow responses down to players who have played every game in a specific group, increasing comparison validity.  

The survey responses were recorded in a table with a column for each question/part and a row for each response/person. I downloaded this table as a Comma Separated Values file (.csv) and setup a spreadsheet in Excel so that I can look at particular parts of the table that match certain criteria or filters. Right now I have it setup with input criteria such as Play Extent, Games, and Category, which will generate a table of score data for a particular combination (Example - to look at responses where Play Extent in both ALttP and OoT are ""Beaten Once"" or ""Beaten Multiple Times"" for data values in Category ""Overall""). To get past the player-to-player score variation, I've setup a rank calculator that will display that data in a chart showing what percent of responses ranked games where in a group. There's about 25 *million* combinations or queries to run this way, varying by size and specificity. The queries only take a couple seconds to make, so if there's a way you want to slice the cake, let me know. To start out, I'll put up several examples that are pretty basic. Also let me know if you want the data presented a different way (table, cumulative line chart, or another template). To request a query, just add a comment:

&gt; Play = [Part, Once, Multiple](or a combination), 

&gt; Games = [LoZ, AoL, ALttp, ..., TFH, BotW](list a group of at least two), 

&gt; Category = [Overall, Story, Dungeon, Overworld, Mechanics, Visual, Audio](list one at a time)

So these charts show the ranks each game received among the number of respondents who had played and scored each of them.  When a respondent had multiple games at the same score, the rank is averaged (Two games tied for first each get 1.5st). I'll be happy to answer any questions, I'm still in a rough state of results. 

[Games = LoZ, ALttP, LA, OoA, OoS, tMC | Play = Part, Once, or Multiple | Category = Overall | n = 72
](https://i.imgur.com/oUcEh20.png?1)

[Games = LoZ, ALttP, OoT, MM, tWW, TP, SS, BotW | Play = Once or Multiple | Category: Overall | n = 37

[Games = ALttP, OoT, TP, BotW | Play = Part, Once, or Multiple | Category = Overall | n = 154

I'll keep active for the next few hours, so if you're coming here early, check back in a few days for more results/updates.

Edit: Signing off for the night.  I'm thinking up another chart type for game vs game showing percentages about which ranks higher across overall and six categories: something like this:

truezelda,t3_b7otyn,Is Zant's motivation intentionally a callback to Ganondorf in Wind Waker?,"When you think about it, Zant's motivation is exactly the same as Ganondorf's.

Yet afterwards, Zant's attempts to obtain power resulted in him developing a lust for power for its own sake, same as how Ganondorf desired to rule the whole world in his own image rather than provide for the Gerudo.

If it is, it might explain why Ganondorf chose Zant as his host rather than any other possible Twili renegade during Ganondorf's long imprisonment. Ganondorf likely understood Zant on some level. Not to empathize with Zant mind, but enough to manipulate his desires and get Zant's goals to align with Ganondorf's, while giving Ganondorf enough time to feed off Zant's hatred to restore his power and eventually dispose of him.",52,public,,0

truezelda,t3_b6tcbv,Is Monolith Soft Developing Their Own Zelda Game?,"Like everyone else on this subreddit, after hearing the news that Monolith Soft was hiring for a new Zelda game, I assumed that it was in a support role for the next game from Nintendo. After all, that's what they did for BotW. 

However, then I saw [this video from Gamexplain](https://youtu.be/JfLo30enG_4).

In 2017, months after BotW was released, Monolith Soft revealed that they were working on a brand new game. An archive on this project can be found [here](https://www.resetera.com/threads/monolith-softs-new-project-production-archive.61219/). This is a summary so far:

&gt;This is a brand new project that will offer something different from Monolithsoft's usual brand image. It is a new challenge they are tackling. They are looking for programmers and battle planners for the action portion of the game, specifically people who have experience in action games and able to handle responsive combat.

&gt;They are recruiting ""action game staff"" in particular, and the individual recruitment pages for the action part programmers and action part battle planners specify desired action game experience and responsiveness and enemy AI as things they want to emphasize. For the battle planners, they are also looking for those with an interest in medieval fantasy and understanding of western entertainment trends.

Two pieces of concept art were also released:

Over on the Resetera forum, there is a [thread](https://www.resetera.com/threads/monolithsoft-hiring-staff-for-new-entry-in-the-legend-of-zelda-series.108078/) on the new Monolith Soft recruitment for Zelda. The thread blew up when:

* People noticed the recruitment is for the same positions as the 2017 ""action game"". The pages for both projects link to the same page with the positions. This doesn't happen with other projects listed on the website. 

* People then noticed, upon closer examination of the 2017 concept art, that there are tiny symbols on the walls of the concept art that resemble the triforce / Hylian / Goddess Crest

* Upon realizing the above, people noticed that the statue has wings, and that it could possibly be a statue of the goddess Hylia.

If you don't want to wade through that thread, the Gamexplain video is a good start.

truezelda,t3_b6438c,Would it be better for individual Zelda stories to be more standalone? Not made *to be* nor made *for* sequels?,"This is something I noticed about the earliest Zelda games prior to the GameCube era. The thing about their stories is that they were made to stand on their own. Not to be connected to another game, and not to set up for future games. But after the N64 heyday, it seems that most Zelda games needed to be connected to one another in one way, either to clearly follow up on a previous story, or to blatantly set up for more stories.

After Majora's Mask, it seems that Nintendo comfortably found a franchise they can milk, so they started to take advantage by making the stories connect more. On the 3D front, Wind Waker and Twilight Princess both examined the consequences of the ending of OoT: Ganon escaping his imprisonment after being sealed in another dimension (the Sacred Realm being a fabrication of localization), and Ganon managing to become the villain after being caught red-handed because of OoT Zelda's miscalculation. The 2D front brought the Four Swords saga, which started with a semi-game (less than a full game, more than a mini-game) packaged with ALttP, then expanded into a saga about a lesser holy sword and a miniscule elf corrupted by powerlust and ultimately manipulated by Ganon. Then the DS brought the two ""Adult Timeline"" games, where Link and Tetra get stopped on their way to reestablish Hyrule, then succeed, and then said new Hyrule gets accosted by its own new demon king. The only exceptions are the Oracle games, which tie into each other, but aren't really connected to any other installment in-game, despite Hyrule Historia and Encyclopedia trying to do so.

After Spirit Tracks, though, it seems that they've started to take the opposite direction: namely that it seems that the games are written **to have** sequels rather than **to be** sequels. Skyward Sword starts and ends giving no real explanation of where the Demon Tribe really comes from, apparently setting that up for a future game, and the ending also begs for a sequel by setting up a scenario where the Skyloftians explore and settle Hyrule. But that wasn't followed up on. Breath of the Wild does make an effort to be a standalone story what with its dissociation from the timeline, but it still seems to beg for sequels with its staunch refusal to answer any questions about Calamity Ganon. Much like Skyward Sword, no one explains where Calamity came from, nor how Ganon degenerated into it other than the most rudimentary nods to Demise. They even continued the story sequel practice with A Link Between Worlds, which explicitly refers to the events of ALttP, and takes place (relatively) not too long afterwards. Oddly, the most standalone game in this period is TriForce Heroes, which again, isn't connected to any other story in-game despite Aonuma saying that it's ALBW's Link.

Honestly, I think this practice of having everything be connected to one another is a sin of franchising, just a glorified way of advertising to make more money. Thankfully, Nintendo has done a good job of restraining this practice so that the series isn't as overwrought as Kingdom Hearts or Marvel CU, and most of the games I talked about don't really need to be experienced as sequels per se. But I still think the series would be best off wrapping each Zelda game with a neat little bow, and soft rebooting for the next game.

If they are to continue with the view that ""Yes, Zelda has a timeline; no, it's not important"", they really should go back to the SNES/N64 times and make it so that the stories truly stand on their own. Have a hero rise up, have a villain to fight, and have that story concluded with no intention of continuing it or continuing another story.",10,public,,0

In the Temple of Courage there is a square gem that you carry around to place in square-shaped sockets. When the gem is in a certain socket in the main room of the dungeon, it opens a door to a large room with an invisible floor that leads to an isolated platform with a chest that gives you the bow and arrow. From that platform you shoot at an eye on a wall that creates a bridge that leads to another platform, which has a door up to another area with a gem socket and a door that opens leading to the main room.

The issue is that in my infinite dumbassery I was toting the gem around to random places and died while I was holding it on the isolated platform where I got the bow and arrow. Since I don't have the gem I can't open the door that I used to originally get to the platform, and since I died the bridge leading away from the platform has disappeared and I can't bring the bridge back because the eye that creates the bridge is off my screen.

They have all sorts of tactics and weapons, but feel a bit basic, until we look at the scattered lore of the game.

  
Monument 3: "" *the cunning Lizalfos general saw an opening and seized it, driving the king's forces into a corner. Just when the general's sword was ready to crash down upon the king, a miracle took place.* ""

This shows that the Lizalfos are smart enough to rank high enough to command armies of monsters, as well as *almost* take out Zora's Domain, as well as the Zora army. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lizal shield: ""*A common shield found among the Lizalfos. It's made of metal, but its sloppy craftsmanship offers poor durability.* ""

The Lizalfos evidently hold some skill in metal-working, able to create dangerous slashing weapons like spears, acceptable shields, sturdy bows, and even precisely curve blades to create boomerangs. 

With this sort of ability, they must have had a strong military, intelligent workers, and a steady supply of metal.

&amp;#x200B;

Continuing on, we see several Lizal ""Villages"", often built along shorelines or in lakes, these are placed in easily defendable locations, feature ramps and decks, barrels, as well as bridges, and carry fishing nets. Lizal have apparently learned to fish, expending less effort than Blin groups, which hunt by brute force. Also seen around these ""Villages"" are Octoroks, perhaps indicating some sort of agreement with the cephalopods.

&amp;#x200B;

The placements of their buildings along the road to Zora's domain also show tactical planning, the palisades blocking and channeling any trespassers into the range of the archers and their towers, as well as ""Highly seasoned"" warriors, wielding the more advanced Lizal weaponry, or Zora blades and spears, trophies from battle. Any non-legendary hero would have a tough time passing these well defended bases. If one does manage to avoid these, the Lizalfos also rely on stealth and ambushes, hiding in plain sight, or just out of, either camouflaged on the ground, hiding on a steep cliff, or submerged in water.  

&amp;#x200B;

If the Lizalfos were united once more, in an army, I think they should have no problem taking over Zora's Domain, or other Hyrulean settlements with relative ease, or create peaceful relationships, due to their scientific advancements, culture, and skills, despite being agents of Ganon.

...Was BotW originally intended to take place somewhere between SS and OoT?

Any evidence from the development process of BotW is acceptable to compile here, in discerning the developers' original decisions, but if you're interested, let's narrow-down what they swept under the rug before coming to place BotW in the purposefully ambiguous timeline position on which it currently sits.

Do any of you guys love to take short cuts in Zelda games? A lot of the Zelda games are linear, but I prefer open world and exploring the game out of order. Wall Clipping can help with this especially in Zelda 3, since all the dungeons are connected. Tis a shame, when you can't take short cuts in Zelda games.

truezelda,t3_b35xhj,Does Ganondorf know that Link is the HoT in OoT?,"It's been a while since I played so I can't remember if it is explicitly stated in-game.  

I know he *does* state his knowing that Link ""held the keys to the door of time"" when he's thanking Link for leading him to the sacred realm, really indicating that he knew what was going on and was essentially baiting Link and Zelda into opening the door for him.  However, this is also protected by the master sword meaning either:

a.) Ganondorf knew enough about the door of time and entering the sacred realm but *not* that it was also sealed with the Master Sword in the Pedestal of Time. He happened to get lucky with Link being able to wield it. 

or

b.) He knew about the Master Sword and suspected/knew that Link would be able to pull it and let him in, which is a more believable motive for not killing link at any point earlier than having a 10 year old do all the legwork of collecting stones

and yes, obviously I know in game, he would not have been known as the ""hero of time"" until after beating Ganon, so the question is probably better ""Did Ganondorf know that Link would be able to wield the master sword?""",53,public,,0
truezelda,t3_b32vkq,How can the Hero's Shade be a Stalfos?,"So, somehow hyrule encyclopedia slipped by me. Aside from the terrible, horrible, rotten termina retcon, the hero's shade being classified as a stalfos rubs me the wrong way.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this mean the Hero of Time got lost in the lost woods? How is that possible, considering he grew up knowing the way through them?

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly: stalfos are physical beings. The Hero's shade is decidedly spiritual. He takes Lonk to another plane to train him. He only appears as the golden wolf, symbolic of his heroic spirit, in the real world. There are a couple instances when stalfos aren't just mindless enemies, but the ones I remember are in MM so are they not canon either?

&amp;#x200B;

Any way you look at it, including even his appearance (the shade appears to be more than just bones), he's either not a stalfos or he's a unique stalfos unlike any we've seen before.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? And if he's not a stalfos...does this break any claim of the encyclopedia to be canon? I'd love to be able to shake my head and say ""nah"" at the idea of termina being a pointless nothingburger.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, u/Serbaayuu, I didn't think of it the other day but the existence of the Hero's Shade seems to support my theory of the ""spirit of the hero"" and demise's curse as being separate from the beings themselves. Otherwise, how could the shade and the Hero of Twilight exist concurrently (even if one is only a spirit)? I'd rather the shade not be a stalfos, but if he is that seems to be even stronger evidence towards my claim.",29,public,,0

truezelda,t3_b2qjgy,[Theory] A little theory on the Great Fairies in BOTW,"Something that always stood out to me regarding the great fairies in BOTW is how each one of them has a different plant growing around their fountains. Trying to come up with some significance to this fact, I tried to tie this up with the great faries found in OoT and MM, as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Tera: her fountain is surrounded by cool, warm and electric safflina. These represent the 3 kinds of magic attacks/weapons found not only in BOTW but on several Zelda games (ice/fire/electric-light). So Tera represents the Great Fairy of Magic.

Mija: her fountain is surrounded by armoranths. These raise your defense when cooked, and in both OoT and MM the Great Fairy of Courage grants you enhanced defense (white outline on your hearts). So Mija represents the Great Fairy of Courage.

Kaysa: her fountain is surrounded by mighty thistles. These raise your attack when cooked, so Kaysa represents the Great Fairy of Power.

Cotera: her fountain is surrounded by blue nightshades. This one is the greatest stretch, but my thinking is: blue nightshades increase your stealth when cooked, which makes me think they have a close relation to another blue plant that also glows in the dark and also increases your stealth: the Silent Princess, which in BOTW is closely linked to Princess Zelda, which is the bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom. So Cotera represents the Great Fairy of Wisdom.

&amp;#x200B;

I know all this is probably a stretch, but that's what I cam up with trying to find significance and a link to previous Great Fairies in the Zelda series.

Personally, I've always been a big fan of villains where you can sympathise with their motives, even if you don't agree with their methods. Ganondorf in WW tries to paint himself in this light at the end of the game, as if everything he'd done up to that point had been to try and save his people. The MCU has had a really good run of villains like this in Phase 3, with characters like the Vulture (trying to provide for his family), Killmonger (doesn't want Wakanda to be isolationist), and Thanos (trying to solve overpopulation). All of those are legitimate problems, it's just their solutions that make them the bad guys.

Ganondorf I is basically locked into being a right bastard thanks to his actions in OoT, but I think it could be interesting to do a Ganondorf II who really is just trying to provide for his people, like Ganondorf I in WW wants you to believe he was doing. Nintendo could do a Ganondorf II who rules over a destitute desert people, who delves into the demonic arts and tries to take over Hyrule in order to save his people from their inevitable slow demise. Nintendo doesn't necessarily have to make him morally grey, they can still have him be brutally violent and destructive (like Thanos), I just think Nintendo should give the next villain a better motivation than ""is evil because.""",51,public,,0

truezelda,t3_b24q5u,Why Ocarina of Time has the best dungeons in the series,"I want to start this with a nostalgia disclaimer: I grew up on 2D Zelda and the Wind Waker. Ocarina of Time was a late play for me, and an incredible one. Recently I've been playing Breath of the Wild, and its big, empty world leaves me with very mixed feelings. 

I've been replaying OoT, and I think that there are two things that each dungeon does that makes the dungeons really stand out: 1) The dungeons are embedded in the plot, and 2) each dungeon has a unique gimmick which isn't related to the dungeon item. I'm mostly going to talk about the adult temples, as I think the kid temples are an extended tutorial. 

1.
The balance between overworld and dungeons is an interesting one. In 2D Zelda, the dungeons are nondescript caves. Each has a rough theme (especially from the Minish Cap onwards), but almost without exception you descend into it to get one of x mcguffins. Pre-OoT, if you jumbled up the dungeons and mismatched them with their location in the overworld, it wouldn't really matter. Most are detatched from their place, and once you're inside the plot pauses until you get back out. (This has a few exceptions, e.g. Hyrule Castle) Plot is an overworld thing, and action is a dungeon thing. 

This isn't true in OoT. In each of the adult dungeons, you encounter a character. Ganondorf in the forest temple, Darunia in the fire temple, Ruto in the water temple, and Nabooru and Twinrova in the spirit temple. The shadow temple is the obvious exception, and the absence of a companion is conspicuous -- making it a solitary journey, highlighting the eeriness of the atmosphere, and the strangeness of the voice from the walls. All of this means that the plot doesn't grind to a halt while you're inside a dungeon. Infact, you're learning about the characters, deepening your knowledge of the world, and moving things along.

All of this helps the dungeons feel like places that significant to the world they are embedded in. I think part of this is that you're exposed to many of the dungeons as a child before you enter them as an adult. You visit the sacred forest meadow, climb death mountain, see the gate above the graveyard, swim in the well, and dive to the bottom of the lake, before you knew there was anything significant there. OoT has a high density of dungeons, if you count mini dungeons, there's 11 in an overworld you can cross in five minutes. They feel like significant, integrated, important places! Compare this to Woodfall, which is a temple out-of-place in a swamp with no path in, in an area you'd never visit otherwise. 

2.
Each dungeon has something interesting going on. In the Forest temple you hunt down ghosts. In the fire temple you release prisoners. In the water temple you revisit the same rooms underwater. The shadow temple is a horror show where you have to determine what's real and what's not. And the spirit temple is a time travel adventure. They're not just a series of puzzles to showcase the dungeon item, infact that's almost always a secondary feature, which is how many dungeons are in other games. 

Again, this is great storytelling. And the unique aspects of dungeons is something that other Zelda games have tried to replicate (e.g. rescuing monkeys in the forest temple in TP), but haven't pulled off so consistently or so well. These temples feel ancient, deeply reflect the lore, and feel like they have a purpose in the society of the region they were built in. 

---

So applying all this to Breath of the Wild, there were a few weird decisions made in the divine beasts. It's cool you can do them in any order, but weird that they all tell the same story with the same beats and different characters in them. I never really got the impression that people had a relationship with their divine beasts. Also all the shrines teleport you to some weird other world which is exactly the same throughout -- I never felt connected to the Sheikah society, or really felt that these things were in the world, or relevant to the world they're in. It felt like I was playing a video game in a video game world. 
In conclusion, I think the worldbuilding and commitment to viewing the dungeons as integrated parts of the plot is what makes Ocarina of Time's dungeons some of the best in the series. ",106,public,,0

truezelda,t3_b2acvy,What do you people really want out of the main quest/main story?,"Some people might claim that all they want out of the main quest is a nice set of dungeons. But we mustn't forget: the main quest is more than just dungeons. I've said it before, but there seems to be too little talk about what makes the main quest good aside from just dungeons.

That said, we seem to all agree what makes main quests bad. It all started with the Triforce Quest in Wind Waker, but came in full force with the succeeding games. We don't like backtracking like repeat visits to the ruined Kakariko Village or the three Surface areas. We don't like fetch questing such as searching for Tears of Light or Kikwis. We really don't like long tutorialization. We especially don't like interacting with bland characters like the Ordon Kids or the Kikwis, Mogmas, and Parellas of the Surface. Most of all, we just don't like to be forced through a whole bunch of busywork just to progress to the good parts.

And yet when BotW's main quest goes ahead and cuts out the backtracking and fetch questing entirely, has arguably some of the most fleshed-out characters since Majora's Mask (even in the sidequests at that), introduces nonlinearity by having almost all of the main quest segments be completed in any order, and generally keeps things moving, people say that BotW's main quest is bad. Why? Just because it's shorter? Of course it would be shorter; I thought we as a collective of gamers agreed that having quality over quantity is the way to go. Most writers can't make a good story over like 5 hours; wouldn't it be better to make the story that short while unloading and fluff to optional content? BotW does just that, yet people throw that back in Nintendo's face.

I'm just really confused as to what people actually want out of the main quest in a Zelda game. BotW moves back to the quick pace and heartfeltedness of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask when it comes to its main quest while adding nonlinearity on top of that, yet people think it's not good enough?

truezelda,t3_b138sj,Someone else brought up the idea of playing as an evil Link in a future game. Most are against the idea. Here's a counterpoint.,"The idea of playing as a more morally ambiguous, borderline selfish hero is interesting at face value, but wouldn't make sense with the context of the lore. Link is always supposed to embody the spirit of the hero and courage itself, after all, just as Ganon is always supposed to embody Demise's wrath and lust for power.

But what if there was more to our protagonist than initially let on?

Say our game starts with a Link who has less-than-noble goals. Starting off with petty get-back-at-a-bully pranks, or stealing something valuable from his town's shady leader, stuff that can be relatable but in execution definitely isn't ""the right thing to do"". But because he's skilled with a sword and with items and stuff, Link always prevails. And the fact that he wears the hero's garb doesn't go unnoticed by his peers.

The idea that our Link isn't as heroic as legends said he'd be would be acknowledged and lampshaded throughout the adventure, with people only tolerating whatever crap he pulls off because they believe that, despite his flaws, he's still the hero destined to save the land from evil. The legend of the Hero's Spirit would be common knowledge at this point and all signs of the Hero's most notable qualities; a strong will, mastery of weapons and exploration, indomitable, that sort of thing; still point to our main character. Everyone, Link included, believes that he's destined for greatness, even if Link (and his partner of the week) specifically only wants power and glory over anything else the history books promise him. The first portion of the game would sort of be a twisted version of the standard OoT/ALttP pendant collecting, which Link only commits to because he wants to be the strongest in Hyrule or something else that's totally self-serving.

Until halfway through the adventure, where out of hiding, we see a *different* Link pop up as an obstacle to the protagonist Link that we've been following this whole time.

Without going too far into it, the idea is basically that the Link the player's been controlling this entire time was nothing more than an impersonator, and the true reincarnation of the Hero is now the player's biggest rival in their quest for power. It'd also be at this time where our Link sides with Ganondorf/other villain of the week in an attempt to achieve said goal.

The rest of the adventure focuses on helping to build up the villain's rule by conquering dungeons and obtaining the MacGuffins of the week before Hero Link has the chance to do the same. And despite not having the spirit or will of the Hero of Legend, protagonist Link still has just as much skill. Which doesn't go against any sort of lore, seeing how the Hero of Winds wasn't even a destined hero in the first place until after he found the Triforce of Courage entirely on his own.

Which would lead to my final point in this hypothetical narrative: a redemption arc. Throughout the adventure, Princess Zelda would serve as the moral compass to protagonist Link, pleading for him to not succumb to Ganon's influence, how power can be achieved through more than just dark rule and selfish desires, bla bla bla, basically this but with a more refined script, which is backed up by just how horrible of a person Ganon can be, and what he does to the innocents that just want to live peacefully. However little at a time, this does slowly affect protagonist Link.

It's only after Hero Link *dies* to Ganon in the game's climax (again, not contradicting any lore; Downfall Timeline and all), that protagonist Link, after everything he witnessed and everything Zelda told him about what it means to be a great warrior, finally has a change of heart. As Hero Link passes, the Triforce of Courage is passed on to protagonist Link, who takes it upon himself to betray his loyalty to Ganon and take him down on his own, probably with Hero Link's Master Sword or something too.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm aware that it would take some seriously careful scriptwriting for this story to not come across as forced, or contrived, or overly cliche even for Zelda standards, but I think this idea has potential.

The Zelda series has already hinted at the fact that the Hero isn't always destined to win, that the Hero isn't always destined to be the Hero from the very beginning, and that there are many who take on the guise of the Hero without actually being the reincarnation of him to begin with. The only way a morally ambiguous Link would work is if for one, it wasn't the real Link, and/or two, the morally ambiguous Link would have to *earn* the title of the Hero through their actions later on.

There's no way Nintendo would make a Zelda game where Link is the bad guy who wins in the end, but a Zelda game about a misguided hero who needs to turn to the side of good and live up to the spirit of the hero he chose to don? That's a different story. It allows for a different perspective along with different gameplay elements and side quests alongside it, without completely shattering the integrity of Link's reincarnations in the process.

It's still super-rough, mostly because hell if I'm going to make an entire script for a game that's never going to exist, but it just came to mind when people were so quick to shoot the initial idea down. I agree that a Link who's a bad guy through and through isn't going to fly, but a game where Link is unashamedly the bad guy until he proves his worth? That's something I could totally get behind.",9,public,,0

truezelda,t3_b19b25,I wish Nintendo went crazier with Zelda spinoffs,"I don't know why, but I've started to think how nice it would be if the series really flexed its franchise power and really went whole hog with spinoffs. Looking at [Wikipedia's own list of Zelda spinoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Legend_of_Zelda_media#Spin-offs), the selection really is meager. We just have (certain ones made by Phillips, I will pretend don't exist):

* The Zelda LCD games (including a Game &amp; Watch)
* The Satellaview games (which are styled after main series games anyway)
* The Tingle series
* Link's Crossbow Training
* Hyrule Warriors
* Zelda Picross

It's rather pathetic. There's more that this series can do if it could really stretch its wings and went into spinoff territory. Even series that aren't as big like Kirby or Megami Tensei have loads of spinoffs. Why can't we see Zelda take on various other genres and experiment with them? We could have:

* A pure environmental puzzle game (for those who just like moving objects around and putting them in the right place to progress)
* A fighting game (like Soulcalibur to make up for the loss of Link in that series)
* A turn-based RPG such as
   * Something in the line of Final Fantasy
   * A classic-style dungeon crawler like Ultima or Wizardry
   * A strategy RPG like Fire Emblem
   * A Mysterious Dungeon game like those made for Pok√©mon or the Final Fantasy Chocobo series
   * Some type of procedurally-generated dungeon game like Roguelikes do.
* An Action-RPG such as
   * A Diablo-like
   * A Souls-like
   * Something more in the line of Witcher 3 or Skyrim, moreso than BotW and with nearly no puzzle elements
* An RTS like Warcraft where you actually command armies to fight one another
* A MOBA like Dota or League of Legends
* A horse racing game (yes I'm just spitballing ideas at this point)
* Maybe a minigame collection where you play various games with the Zelda heroes (there are more than enough, and the villains don't make sense)
* Maybe a Fortune Street or Dokapon Kingdom-type board game?
* Another platformer, this time with no overworld elements and just pure platforming

And there are much, much more they can do. There are so many things the series can do, and they can definitely fit into all the things I listed if they could really stretch their imaginations.

Let's see Nintendo really take the franchise into new ground without stepping on the toes of the main series too much (hell, too many people are arguing that BotW is doing just that). Let's see them take advantage of what the series has done, its beloved characters, and memorable locations, and make use of them in strange ways without having to shoehorn them back into new games.

And don't come in here saying that ""spinoffs will dilute the franchise"". Spinoffs will expand the franchise in unique ways that can't be done with just a plain mainline game. Zelda is open to a lot of things: trains, linear storytelling, open world, but the crazier things need spinoffs to enter the franchise. There's no need to be as intolerant of spinoffs as the Metroid fandom seems to be.",1,public,,0

truezelda,t3_b0pf2i,Theory: The SkullKid Parallel,"I'm not serious with this one, I think it's just a bit of coincidence that leads to an odd interpretation of the MM plot.
I'll start this off with the premise that the dragons of SS took on different parallel forms causing Termina to have a different biomes.
Without Lanayru the ocean to the west wouldn't dry up due to overuse of technology. The mountains to the north wouldn't have become volcanic if Eldin wasn't fighting demonic forces. Finally the southeast wouldn't become a forest without Faron regulating the water, instead the south has too much water and the east has none. 
The parallel forms that the dragons (and Levias) take are the four giants who protect their regions in different ways.
In this case the best known parallel to the Imp that befriended them would be Hylia. It's strange to imagine that a mere skullkid caused so much trouble that four giants had to be called in, or that it would 'return to the heavens'. It would make more sense if the imp was actually a greater spirit that returned to its realm.
Continuing from the notion that this imp was Hylia we could imagine that the skullkid was actually the human vessel that the imp spirit reincarnated into, in this case to exploit a loophole of being banished as a spirit, not a mortal.
If this was the case during MM the main plot would be rescuing parallel undead SS Zelda from possession.",35,public,,0
truezelda,t3_b0ig5t,Two ideas for a haunted house themed dungeon.,"- A haunted house themed dungeon akin to the Forest Temple from OoT, but the lore and the premise of this particular dungeon setting being inspired by the Borley Rectory in England. Basically a Mansion built atop the ruins of an ancient Monastery where a nun was sealed within its cellars after being caught in a romantic affair with a monk (who was hanged). The house, isn't abandoned like the forest temple, it is still inhabited by living people who only recently vacated the building when the alleged spirits haunting it became seemingly aggressive. Corrupted and controlled by a demonic presence that descended upon the mansion.  

- Another Mansion, but built atop a cemetery a la poltergeist. This one haunted because the spirits of those buried are angry that their graves were defiled so that this structure could be built (You son of a bitch, you left the bodies and you only moved the headstones!). Their bodies being literally under the stone flooring of the basement. the most angry of these spirits being the spirits of the Royal Family.

My Answer: Zelda 2 is a better game than the original Zelda. In terms of how far the series has gone over the years, zelda 1 just hasn't aged well like a majority of other NES games. I find the game tedious and drag to get through and I feel there is no reason to go back to the game when games like A link to the past and a link's awaking exist. Now Zelda 2 is not that really great of game, it's annoyingly difficult and poorly designed in a lot of places, but it rewarding and fun to get into because of how different it is from other games in the series.

truezelda,t3_b0gptz,How Similar is Ganon to Mario?,"We know the first Zelda and Mario games were developed like opposites. What with one being a fast side-view game and the other being a slow top-down game. But this contrast could have another aspect to it. The villain of one game could be a warped representation of the other game's protagonist. Bowser might mirror Link. Ganon might mirror Mario. I'm not proposing this as a real concept but as a fun topic to discuss. It does, though, have some curious support and I'll keep it as a small, kooky headcanon.

I'll be focusing on Ganon-to-Mario rather than Bowser-to-Link. But I'll start the list with this:



NES Bowser and NES Link have similar palettes. The same goes for Ganon and Mario.


To this day, red is a common color between Ganon n' Mario



They, Mario and Ganondorf, both have pronounced noses. Though all Gerudo people have that.


They both are tied to a specific, empowered state. Though Bowser's been getting that a lot too, lately.


They both focus on natural resources rather than mechanical devices.


They're both visually stylish, or flamboyant, one could state, as opposed to the more basic style of the other duo.

truezelda,t3_azqt3g,Twilight Princess isn't an Ocarina of Time clone,"Let me start by saying that Twilight Princess was not my favourite Zelda.  Even when I first played it, I was left with more little nitpicks with it than I had with most other Zelda games.  But while there are many valid criticisms one could make against Twilight Princess, I don't think it being ""OoT 2.0"" or an ""OoT clone"" is one of them, because despite some common claims, TP is really not any more similar to OoT than many other games in the series are.

As far as plot and progression go, there's less similarity between OoT and TP than there is between OoT and WW/LttP.  There's no collecting of pendants, spiritual stones or goddess pearls as the initial goal.  There's no legend about Ganon previously being defeated early in the game.  Zelda has next to nothing to do with what you do on your journey.  Instead, the vast majority of the game's plot is about you ridding Hyrule of Twilight and trying to stop Zant and help Midna, while also protecting some people from your village and a few others you meet along the way.  Admittedly, Ganondorf and Zelda *do* become quite prominent at the end, but in OoT they were driving forces of the plot the entire way through (before you even gain control of Link at the start of the game).

As far as characters go, Link, Zelda and Ganondorf are the only ones that are returning characters, and Zelda and Ganondorf's roles are relatively small in the scheme of things.  At best, you could make some parallels between some of the other characters, but if they were really just copying OoT, they could have just brought them back, considering returning characters are something this series does *regularly*.  Epona also returns, but while she debuted in OoT, you can also completely ignore her and still finish the game.  Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess are the only times she's needed for plot progression.

Comparing the dungeons and bosses, there are *some* similarities, but nothing more than is relatively standard for the series.  First dungeon takes place in a tree, but the main mechanics used in both are very different, and while there are some Skulltulas in both, the bosses are completely different.  Second dungeon takes place in Goron mines in both.  But again, the mechanics and bosses are completely different.  Third dungeon is water based in both, but again nothing alike.  Even comparing the third dungeon of TP to the Water Temple isn't especially valid, since it's mechanically more similar to the Great Bay Temple in Majora's Mask (changing the water flow to get to different areas).  Morpheel is clearly a Morpha reference, but it still plays out more differently than some of the WW bosses compared to the OoT bosses (Kalle Demos is *basically* Barinade, and Gohdan is *basically* Bongo Bongo).  From there, the dungeons have much more distinct themes.  Arbiter's Grounds reuses the Poe Sisters mechanic from the Forest Temple, but is otherwise unique.  Snowpeak Ruins is pretty unique, too (are you gonna compare it with Ice Cavern or something?  Because aside from both being ice themed, there's not much else to the comparison).  If anything, the platform swaying mechanic was borrowed from Deku Leaf usage in WW.  Temple of Time is a recurring location, but never a dungeon previously.  And the statue controlling mechanic is more of an expansion from a WW idea than anything borrowed from OoT.  You *could* argue the Darknut is like the Iron Knuckles from OoT and that Armogohma is after Gohma in OoT, too.  But both existed since the very first Zelda game, so even that hardly supports the argument.  City in the Sky was unique, as was the Palace of Twilight.  And Hyrule Castle wasn't very similar to the OoT version (or any of the other versions), either.

How about the items?  Well, we've got bombs, slingshot, boomerang, bow and iron boots.  Of those, the slingshot is the only one that serves virtually the same purpose.  Water Bombs and Bomblings (somewhat of a Bombchu replacement) increased the uses of Bombs.  The boomerang now combines elements of the WW Boomerang and Deku Leaf into a single item.  The Bow now can get a scope and Bomb Arrows are a thing.  Iron Boots have their gravity-defying uses in addition to the stuff they had previously been used for.  The Dual Clawshots were a significant change to the traditional Hookshot.  The Lantern came back from LttP.  And the Spinner, Ball and Chain, and Dominion Rod were entirely new.  The Hylian Shield returns, but no great significance is given to it.  Tunic swapping returns, too, if you want to count that.  Fishing is a thing again, though Link's Awakening is the first game where that appeared.  Wolf Link's sensing abilities share some functionality with the Eye of Truth, though they are used for much more than just that.  The battle skills expand on WW's parry system.  So aside from the Slingshot and Iron Boots, that's mostly just the standard returning items back with a number of new ones thrown in.

Items that didn't return?  Mirror Shield (despite being in every other console game since LttP), Hover Boots, Hammer, Din's Fire, Nayru's Love, Farore's Wind, Fire Arrows, Ice Arrows, Light Arrows (and magic on the whole), Deku Nuts, Goron Bracelet (and the other two strength upgrades).  Bombchus, Ocarina, Zora/Golden Scale, Lens of Truth and Hook/Longshot were gone, though their functions were still present, more or less.

As far as music goes, relatively little is reused or referenced.  Saria's Song is played by Skull Kid.  But that whole Lost Woods segment is otherwise quite different to the OoT version.  Hyrule Castle is used mixed with Ganondorf's Theme.  A few notes of Kakariko's Theme are referenced.  And Epona's Song is used to call Epona.  Aside from that there's like Zora's Domain and Goron City themes used.  And then bits and pieces of fanfare and such.  (I suppose Zelda's Theme is probably used in there somewhere, too.)  Are there any others I'm forgetting?  Because WW is filled to the brim with OoT music references, so that's not a compelling argument, either.

So is there some angle I'm missing here that everyone else is seeing?  Because to me, Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess don't seem any more similar than any other two games in the series are (in fact, I'd say that WW is much more similar to OoT in many ways than TP is.  And that OoT is more similar to LttP than TP is to OoT.).  I will say that the direction they took with Twilight Princess was *very much* in response to criticisms that Majora's Mask and Wind Waker received (hence the large number of dungeons and more ""mature"" artstyle in TP) and that the developers were very much aiming to please the fans of OoT that didn't like the direction they took things with MM and WW (which leads into some of my criticisms of the game).  But you're making a bit of a leap to say that that means the two games are near identical, or that TP is ""just an upgraded OoT"" or something, because even though they were very much hoping to win over the audience that OoT had managed to win, the two games in reality don't share much more in common than any other two Zelda games.",99,public,,0
truezelda,t3_b03bxa,How would the Hylians and other inhabitants of Hyrule react and respond in this kind of situation?,"A situation where even though the Hylians themselves have forgotten about past incarnations of Hyrule and it's history, kingdoms and nations outside of Hyrule still remember the old Hyrules in the past. The reasons being that these other kingdoms didn't have to suffer through a big bad destroying their land, monster infestations, countless apocalypses and cataclysm and/or mass illiteracy and are able to record more extensive and accurate observations and documentations. some of their knowledge of Hyrule and it's history coming from translated copies of books (Book of mudora) coming from Hyrule in the past. another benefit of having the printing press and the ability to mass produce copies of books.

Imagine an outsider going to the present incarnation of Hyrule (for the purpose of studying the present cultures) and then running into a situation where the Hylian version of the kingdom's History has become so muddled in myth and legend as well as being so heavily embellished and exaggerated if not extremely Biased that it doesn't line up with his countries' established and more accurate view of Hyrule and it's past.

truezelda,t3_azis0i,15 Shared Mechanics from Majora's Mask to Wind Waker (xpost r/Zelda),"After reading that segment in the Hyrule Encyclopedia about a programmer for the whips of Majora's Wrath being brought over to work on Wind Waker's string physics, I wondered what else was shared between these games, and if WW was a truer successor than I initially realized. So I played through the HD version again, took note of everything similar and made a video on the topic:

https://youtu.be/i5tJqVv0U04

If you don't care to watch, I wrote out the list in order:

* 1) Returning enemies: Gyorg (boss in MM, now a common enemy of the Great Sea), Real Bombchus (what the bomb-throwing Rats of WW are nicknamed in-game), Chuchus.

* 2) Spirits: Darmani III/Mikau to Makar/Laruto. Both are deceased characters that seek out aid in Link- music is involved in the ""healing"" for both pairs of spirits.

* 3) References: Tijo's drum and several masks appear as decoration in the Nintendo Gallery. Phantom Ganon's sword has the mountain smithies, Zubora and Gubora's names inscribed on its blade.

* 4) Post Office: First game to feature a post office, returning feature in WW. Baito of Dragon Roost looks like the part-timer of Clock Town's trading post, Koboli shares the same face of Termina's postman. Technically these are Ocarina of Time characters- but Baito is a young hire again and in Koboli's case especially, his figurine description explains that he comes from generations of postmen. He's heavily implied to be related to the one from Majora's Mask (even though that clashes with what Hyrule Encyclopedia says about Termina disappearing, which is more of a retcon anyway).

* 5) Post boxes: introduced in Majora's Mask, they still greet and talk to Link. Made more animated in Wind Waker.

* 6) Hide and Seek: Bomber's Secret Society of Justice to Windfall Island's Killer Bees. Both groups are a gang of children rude to outsiders- will only accept Link after playing their game. Works to familiarize the player with the layout of Clock Town/Windfall.

* 7) Tingle: reappearing from Majora, given more importance. Connecting to the Tingle Tuner, he speaks about a legend from the Hero of Time era, in which he helped that incarnation of Link.

* 8) Cartography: Hunting down and buying Tingle's maps throughout Termina is necessary to complete that world's atlas, as is giving Fishmen All-Purpose Bait to record each island of the Great Sea.

* 9) Pirates: Majora was the first to feature them- from Gerudo Pirates to Tetra's Pirate Crew.

* 10) Control: Kafei is the first player-controlled character in the series that isn't Link. Wind Waker takes the concept further and allows for play as animals, animated statues, and the Earth/Wind Temple sages.

* 11) Returning items: Pictobox, given more features. While the Deku Leaf is entirely new, the idea of it and Baba Buds seem to be repurposed from Deku Link's floral-helicopter ability.

* 12) Fast travel by wind: NES Legend of Zelda introduced the flute, which allowed travel by wind. Majora was the console game to bring it back, with Kaepora Gaebora's wings to WW's cyclones. Instead of being a separate item, too- one song is learned on the Ocarina/Wind Waker (instead of many like OoT), and the ability to pick a location of the map is streamlined from A Link to the Past.

* 13) Voice acting &amp; sound: Sachi Matsumoto returns from voicing Skull Kid in MM, to Link/Aryll in WW. The portal noise after defeating a boss in WW is sampled from the Final Hours track of Majora.

* 14) Trading: the Title Deed and Merchant's Oath side quests feel very similar- Link has a role in expanding both the Business Scrubs and Goron Merchant's trade. Link owning property is a shared quirk between both games too- though one is a private cabana and the other is... a flower.

* 15) String! Again, that programmer for the whips of Majora's Wrath was brought over to work on the string physics for Wind Waker. This is neat, because string is used quite a bit (ropes of the drawbridges, Puppet Ganon, etc.)

* 16) Bonus: Though of course not nearly as intricate as Clock Town, Lenzo's Research Assistant quest shows NPCs on Windfall with ""scheduled events""- you can follow them and see their repeated actions every day as if they're actually living life. Time cycles (day/night) are again given high importance. Unrelated, but Blue Bubbles cause curses in both games, disallowing use of equipment (NES Zelda has this too, but Blue Bubbles were a cure instead of the cause).

You could say that they could come up with dungeon ideas that allow for environmental variety, but think about it. Exclude forest dungeons, volcano dungeons, desert dungeons, water dungeons, undead dungeons, ice dungeons, and sky dungeons entirely and there isn't much room to work with after that.

truezelda,t3_az9zk5,Some changes that would improve Twilight Princess's story.,"Similar to r/fixingmovies, these are changes I would make towards the story to make it flow and be presented better. TP's plot is okay but its a bit clunky and poorly paced at times, and I feel the alterations I present would make the game even better. So the changes are:

1. First, Ganondorf should've appeared sooner than him first being mentioned near the middle of the game. I feel the best place for him to show up first is right after you get the last Fused Shadow from the Lakebed, or the cutscene where Zant shows up and nearly kills Midna. He shouldn't show up in human form necessarily, just in his ghost demon head form. During the scene, Zant doesn't mention him by name but clearly says his allegiance to him and talks about how the two are basically partners. Ganondorf should be the one who brings up the idea of killing Midna and Zant agrees, and the cutscene then just mostly plays like normal. They should also establish how the two have a shared life force thing a bit better in this cutscene. Having him appear now would reduce complaints about him ""appearing out of nowhere and hijacking the plot"" and establish his presence earlier so that Link and co. have a better idea of the threat they are up against. Also having him try to kill Midna would motivate Link, and by extension the player, into not liking him, and giving Midna a reason to hate Ganondorf too. 
2. The way that Castle Town reacts to the plot need to change. It's weird how in the game that the civilians just act like everything is normal even though they just saw Hyrule Castle be invaded by weird shadow monsters. Instead of what we got, the game should show that the citizens are extremely worried about the situation unfolding in the Castle. Have people mention how many citizens have already moved out and basically no one has any idea what is going on. Soldiers should be patrolling more to show that they're trying to establish order but have no idea on what to do about the situation. When the giant barrier surrounds the Castle, have even more people panic. Granted, the city should still function and there should still a decent around of people around but at least make the citizens show concern for what's happening
3. Give the Resistance stuff to do. Have the members actually help Link get to the dungeons and go along with him. Maybe they help the player fight off enemies or help clear the way to the dungeon path but don‚Äôt obviously do the dungeons with Link. This could lead to some fun character interactions, gameplay changes and make the ending scene where they help Link give more of an impact.
4. Have part of the Ilia sidequest occur earlier in the game, probably before or after Snowpeak. Maybe you just have to get the first part of her memory as opposed to the second half before the City in the Sky. I imagine that a interesting way to do it is to get the Zora Prince's account of what happened, as if I remember correctly that the two managed to escape together. Another detail that they could add was that the kidnapped kids were checked to see if they had the Triforce symbol on their hands, which Midna could then piece together that Ganondorf wanted to find the potential hero with the Triforce mark. Also, have the horse call be the reward for this quest. This would introduce the quest earlier to make it feel not so tacked on late within the game and help the pacing of the second half of the game. Also, it would explain why the kids were kidnapped in the first place.
5. They should alter what happens to Zelda around the midgame. Instead of her saving Midna and then disappearing for a unexplained reason, just make her collapse to the ground and have Midna say she gave out most of her power to save her or something, which puts her in a coma like state. This would help explain how Zelda just kinda shows up at the end of the game.
6. Just a minor suggestion, but the Mirror of Twilight should be mentioned earlier. Having Midna explain what it is and then it immediately being broken for plot and gameplay maguffins is just kinda silly.

Well, that's it. What's your thoughts? Any suggestions?",74,public,,0
truezelda,t3_azck5d,How much time do you think takes place between games?,"SS&amp;MC- Well, it has to be *a lot*. Enough for the surface to be colonized and for the Skyloftians/Wind Tribe to be forgotten by everyone on the surface. Plus the Eras of Chaos and Prosperity, Temple of Time, Interloper War, the War of the Bound Chest, Picori Festivals once a century, etc. I'd say at a bare minimum 500 years, but it could easily be millennia, I'd put my estimate a little under 1,000 years       

MC&amp;FS- Like in Minish Cap, Four Sword has an untitled prologue hero, so there is a hypothetical Link in between the two games. I'd say a bare minimum of maybe 200 years between MC &amp; FS? I don't think it's a very long time, so maybe 500 max. 

FS&amp;OOT- This one is difficult, since the only event we can really place between them is the Hyrulean Civil War. I'd say it's a century at a minimum, but I feel like it is more than that, maybe even a millennium or more. 

OOT&amp;MM- 1 Year  
  

MM&amp;TP-	Everyone seems to say it's 100 years, but I'm not sure that's canonical, however I feel like it seems accurate, maybe 100 or 200 years? Maybe 500 at most?  

TP&amp;FSA- Wasn't that the weirdest thing in Hyrule Historia? These two games are so different it has to be many, many centuries at a minimum, possible a couple thousand of years. I'm leaning toward the latter.  


OOT&amp;ALTTP- This has to be one of the shorter ones, since most of the events of OOT have yet to fade into legend, much of it is still known factually, I think it could be a little under a hundred years at a minimum, but not more than 2 or 3 centuries.  

ALTTP&amp;LA- 1 or 2 years?   

LA&amp;OOX-	It's really tricky with the retcon, but this has to be a short timespan since it's between ALTTP &amp; ALBW, I'd say between 2 and 3 generations, 100 years tops         
								
OOX&amp;ALBW- I'd say same reasoning as before, no more than a hundred years     

ALBW&amp;LOZ- A long time. It needs enough time for Hyrule to enter a golden age, the tragedy of Princess Zelda I, enough time for the Zelda name to become tradition, for the sleeping Princess to become forgotten, and for Hyrule to fall apart. At a *bare* minimum I would say 500 years. It's more probably several thousand.    

LOZ&amp;AOL- I think it's 2 years     

OOT&amp;WW- A very long time, enough time for Ganondorf to return, Hyrule to be flooded, and forgotten. At a BARE minimum I'd say five hundred years but it's likely millennia.    

WW&amp;PH- I guess a year or so?

Meaning that it's military (or rather ""Self defense forces"") would be outdated and mostly inferior compared t other countries). Soldiers aren't uniformly equipped or adequately armed and there are instances in which they were even given the wrong ammunition as the bullets wouldn't fit the guns or were too small for the guns. where they Any Military vehicles they do produce indigenously are on par with New Zealand's ""Bob Semple Tank"". 

This is not New hyrule but ""Normal"" Hyrule in the child timeline or BOTW timelines assuming there are other nations beyond hyrule that continue to develop naturally since they don't suffer from monsters and have no ancient evil hiding under the ground.

The situation presented being akin to Japan's modernization in the 19th century and Russia's late industrialization period. Though in this situation, it also has to do with the inhabitants of Hyrule having a reluctance to mechanical non-magical technology as well as the unwillingness to destroy the natural beauty of Hyrule, specifically Hyrulians living in non-urban areas and the Royal family themselves.

And also would they at all check if there is any inhabitants that are still alive?

I understand that the ghost shp was a construct by Bellum though it has features that can be interpreted as possible gunports.

And there's also the question of how a such a ship of that size could be built since there aren't any landmasses in the great sea that has substantial forest for that much wood, enough flax for the sails, and sufficient hemp for the ropes.

truezelda,t3_ayz8x8,(IDEA) BOTW Master Mode+ and Master Trials the Roguelike,"**BEWARE! MASSIVE WALL OF TEXT**

***don't say I didn't warn you...***

I'm going to frame my ideas here as if it was a third DLC set. I realize a third DLC set has no way of appearing and the only way these ideas could happen is through modding and the WiiU emulator. All of this is hypothetical if you would indulge me in this pipe-dream. :)

There are two main additions in my ""DLC pack"": A Master Mode+, and a Roguelike Challenge Mode. Both of which would solve my major issues with BOTW's difficulty and replayability.

&amp;#x200B;

**---MASTER MODE+---**

In many ways, a ""seasoned gamer"" should start out with BOTW's Master Mode right away. Apart from some troublesome areas, it only offers a slightly harder experience when one adapts and become more stealthy. I wish I bought the DLC and played Master Mode the first time I played. Normal Mode is of course fine for more causal gamers (nothing wrong with that!). For those who are disappointed with Master Mode (I suppose I am), it is worth noting (and applauding) how much it changes the game with such small changes. It seems like the devs knew what to do with their limited time and budget for the DLC.

Anyways, Master Mode+ is intended for people who have played through the game at least once, and want something to sink their teeth into. It would be way too brutal for newcomers, by design. The changes mostly focus on planning out one's adventure- demonstrating a greater mastery of the game- and allowing for more replayability. I'll list out my ideas, not all of them originate from me, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Basic Changes-**

All changes from vanilla Master Mode persist, with additions...

Master Mode+ is given a new slot on the main menu, with a similar save system like Master Mode.

The loading screen is now Purple?

The bottom left Tri-force icon now has a 'plus' next to it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Inventory**

Only the first row of the meals menu is available at the start of the game. More rows can be purchased with Korok seeds, a row at time up until all three pages are full.

Overall, less Korok seeds are needed to max the Weapon, Bow, and Shields slots. Maxing those and the meals slots will take somewhere between 400-500 Korok seeds altogether, maybe less.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast Traveling will cost 100 rupees. This ups the use of horses. Remember Master Mode+ is meant for returning players, who should know how to adventure more efficiently. Maybe fast traveling to Towers costs less (50 rupees) encouraging returning players to activate them even if they know the map like the back of their hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Only 6 armor slots are available to use while you are roaming around. Allowing for 2 complete sets, or 1 complete set with 3 elemental backups/masks. The other armor pieces that you own are still shown in the menu, just darkened out.

At any inn, stable, and the Korok bed you can swap between the armor pieces in your usable inventory and in your ""storage inventory"".

Should more usable slots be obtainable? idk... I don't like the idea of using Korok seeds for them. Maybe more slots cost spirit orbs, 4 or 8 per slot. The Horned Statue deals with them in the same manner as Hearts and Stamina.

One can still instantly switch between armor pieces like before.

When obtaining a new armor piece, you can switch that one with one in your usable inventory. The remainder goes into the unusable inventory.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dying**

Dying sends you back to the last Goddess Statue that you prayed at, even if you didn't spend any Spirit Orbs when you prayed at it. If none have been prayed at it sends you back to the Shrine of Resurrection. You also start with 3 usable hearts- your health bar doesn't start full.

All items that you collected/Quests/Shrines you completed before you died, you keep after death. However, after reawakening at the Goddess Statue the game saves and all previous saves are deleted.

When you die you lose 4 Spirit Orbs, taken randomly from your amount of hearts, stamina, armor slots\*, or reserve. The Spirit Orbs would only be taken from the reserve if there is at least 4 Spirit Orbs there.

Don't fret too much though... you can buy them back for a price at any Goddess Statue. 1000 rupees per purchase? 500 rupees for the first time plus 100 after each death with a maximum of 2000?

When dying with only 3 heart containers, one wheel of stamina, 6 armor slots\*, and no Spirit Orbs in reserve, no Spirit Orbs are stolen but rupees will be deducted if available.

Having death actually punish the player has been something lacking for a long while in Zelda games. Zelda 1 punished death by sending players away from the depth of the dungeon where they died at and by starting them again weak with 3 usable hearts. My changes give much more weight to the combat without being to nasty. Death only stung because it hurt my pride. ;(

&amp;#x200B;

**Eating**

When eating food or drinking elixirs Link has to have an animation in real-time after the player leaves the pause menu. If multiple items are selected while paused, Link will attempt to eat them, one at a time in order. Link remains stationary while eating but the player can buffer a movement if multiple items are being eaten. After finishing one item Link can move several steps/side hop/back flip/jump if the player buffers before eating the next item. This gives Link a degree of dodge control while eating.

The animation should only last 2-4 seconds and could be relative to the strength of the item. An item that heals a heart's worth could only take a second but one that heals everything plus extra could take 5 seconds to consume.

Furthermore, after eating items that heal hearts, the hearts don't appear instantly. The rate of healing should be about 2-3 hearts per second or less.

Link can also eat while swimming, gliding, riding, and climbing. However the animation takes twice as long as normal. While gliding, Link continues in the direction he his going until control comes back to him.

&amp;#x200B;

While in the helpless animation Link only receives half the damage as normal instead of none of it. (is this a bad idea?)

&amp;#x200B;

All of the dungeon bosses and Ganon are to be made harder. Mostly by making their attacks harder to avoid and more frequent. Health and damage can be upped if appropriate. Sprinkle in several more enemies in the dungeons. Doesn't need to be much harder. Dungeons in BOTW are more about puzzles apart from the bosses.

&amp;#x200B;

Should the armor upgrades be nerfed a bit?

New armor? Spider's set- see below. Bunny Hood- ups movement speed. 

Link takes much more damage from drowning, falling in lava, and falling in bottomless pits. 

&amp;#x200B;

**-SHRINES-**

Master Mode+ comes with a whole new selection of Shrines. They still exist in the same places... but all of the interiors are new and different and harder... Several Shrine interiors always appear in the same locations, such as the Shrines on the Great Plateau. However, most are now randomized, probably in several lists. ""Easier"" shrines can be placed in the same list and should be assigned to be randomized among Shrine locations that are close to the Great Plateau and near towns and stables. Harder ""lists"" of Shrine interiors are given to more obscure Shrine locations.

The Shrine locations still have the same Monk's name. However, the subtitles are now the new randomized Shrines.

No ""Blessing Shrines"" exist.

There are now two different types of Shrines. ""Normal"" Shrines are focused on puzzles mostly. They have the normal blue color palate, and according to the lore, have a dead/spiritually mummified monk presenting you with a trial to prove your heroism, as normal.

However, about half of the Shrines are now ""Corrupted"" shrines. They look identical on the outside, but only after entering does the player know if they are Corrupted. Players cannot fast travel out of corrupted shrines nor can they leave. 0\_0 (Well maybe the player is given a choice. The elevator would always be on top of a ledge that once jumped down from, prevents Link for escaping). Their interiors have a red palate swap of the normal blue shrines and have the ""Blood Moon"" particle effects on at all times. They focus on combat more than puzzles. Puzzles in corrupted shrines are more often than not, Indiana Jones style traps. Malice is strewn all over the place and new enemies appear (discussed later). Stal enemies can also appear.

New lore is made for these Corrupted Shrines. After resurrecting Calamity Ganon 100 years years ago at the bottom of Hyrule Castle, the Yiga Clan was sent out to corrupt as many Shrines as possible and convert them from trials meant to strengthen the coming hero, to traps meant to end him. These historical Yiga Clan members are no joke, unlike the current Yiga Clan. They were cursed with Ganon's power before they where sent out, used that power to overpower the monks in the Shrines. After doing the deed they mummified themselves in a similar but evil manner to the monks. Hence they became Gibdos and redeads...

Upon entering a Corrupted Shrine the Monk would say something like this:

""To you who sets foot in this shrine...

I am &lt;name&gt;. In the name of the

Goddess Hylia, I pray for your life...""

&amp;#x200B;

Every Corrupted Shrine ends with a mini-boss fight with the Yiga Clan member who did the deed. Upon their defeat, the force field (now colored red) around the monk can be popped as normal. All the monks are seen to be ""slain"" in different ways, with swords piercing their abdomens, arrows in their heads, and such. They then say:

""Your resourcefulness in overcoming this

trap speaks to the promise of a hero...

In the name of the Goddess Hylia, I bestow

upon you this Spirit Orb.

...

Forgive me for my failure.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**-NEW ENEMIES-**

BOTW lacks in enemy variation. However, it is worth being charitable and noticing how interesting the core enemies: Bokoblins, Lizalfos', and Moblins are. The bestiary of BOTW is a bit sparse but I would rather have a smaller cast of enemies who are interesting rather that a larger cast who are forgettable. Still, some more should be added. :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Corrupted Shrine Enemies**:

All Corrupted Shrine Enemies only appear in Corrupted Shrines, Hyrule Castle, Divine Beasts, and maybe several Overworld areas with a lot of Malice.

&amp;#x200B;

As discussed earlier, Gibdos and redeads make a reappearance. Several of each can appear in a shrine, but there is always a supped-up one as the ""boss"" of the shrine. They have a Japanese/Yiga model design.

Like other 3d incarnations of Gibdos/redeads they can freeze you with their sight. The upside-down Sheikah symbol glows and Link must button-mash out of it. Perhaps they use the statis effect on you. Gibdos have more health but freeze you less than redeads. After freezing you, their bodies stay in place but their necks enlarge. Their heads approach you to suck on your face. 0\_0 They are overall more mobile than previous incarnations of them, and can teleport in characteristic Yiga fashion. Maybe Gibdos can also ensnare you in their wraps.

&amp;#x200B;

""Bubbles"" i.e. Cursed Bokoblins, Moblins, and Moblins now prevent you from attacking with your weapon for 10 or so seconds after they hit you. They appear in cursed shrines by coming out of cursed mouths. Pop those eyes to alleviate the pressure!

&amp;#x200B;

Darknuts: Twisted piles of ancient materials and malice formed into a large approximation of a man. They carry large (unusable by Link) ancient shields that all but prevent Link from attacking head-on. Large new two-handed swords (usable by Link) are swung with one hand by these monsters and on top of their ""heads"" is one guardian eye. So they can shoot lasers...  Upon death they drop their sword and ancient materials. Some are these can be considered ""boss"" monsters.

&amp;#x200B;

Vires: Nasty demons made entirely out of malice. They fly for short bursts and spit out new ""Malice keeses"" to swam you. After death several more keese spawn.

&amp;#x200B;

Lanmolas: Giant worms that hide in the malice before jumping out to attack you. They try to pull you in...

&amp;#x200B;

Like Likes: Giant formless blobs of malice. When they eat you they steal weapons/bows/shields from you on top of damage. After defeat they drop those stolen items but with a lot less durability and removed upgrades.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overworld Enemies**: (These enemies would be more likely to be added into normal mode also)

Skulltulas: Giant spiders that spawn only at night alongside cliff faces. When they find you, they will wrap you up in silk before dealing a large amount of damage. Upon death they drop new junk materials for elixirs along with silk. Silk can be held and dropped in the way of monsters to snare them for a bit, among other uses. Perhaps a new spider armor set could exist. It ups climbing speed and makes it so that you are unstickable.

&amp;#x200B;

Peahats/Leevars: At least in BOTW they will be the same species. Leevars are the 'larval' form while Peahats are the adult. Because of this they drop the same sort of items. Besides one or two generic items only worth using in recipes, they both drop what I call a ""Peavar Core"". This is the central vegetative-muscle that provides their ability to spin. Holding a Peavar Core and then placing it on something will cause it to stick and then provide torque. One can stun enemies with it and have them drop their weapons, all the while making them spin around like idiots. One can place it on weapons to have them spin around, better yet with an octo-ballon also. Placing one on a Gibdo will cause it to unravel its protective fabric. What other uses can you think of?

&amp;#x200B;

Leevars: Leevars spawn anywhere there is a large stretch of sand: river banks, ocean beaches, and of course the Gerudo Desert. Small ones are little more than a nuisance, but they do have a surprisingly forceful attack, knocking Link quite a bit back from their spin. There are much larger ones that are assumed to be the larval forms of the larger peahats. These ones really knock Link far away! Maybe in the desert they can create mini-tornados (like the ones from the Rito-boss) from their spinning.

&amp;#x200B;

Peahats: Peahats look close to the OoT version of themselves. They like to spawn in high open places. Small ones can be seen flying during the day. Once they notice you they will drift toward you before swooping down after you and back up. Rinse and repeat. These flying small ones don't spawn at night.

There are two larger sizes of Peahats. The medium sized one is a bit smaller than the large one in OoT and the larger one is even bigger and is another overworld boss monster, with health bar, new music, and all. They can be found in those large empty mountain ridges that are all over Hyrule. They rarely spawn while flying and mostly start rooted down in the ground and emerge when approached. At night they burrow even deeper into the ground and are untouchable.

The behavior of both sizes are similar though. They will spend sometime hovering before going in for the kill. During their sweeps, they can glide over gentle slopes, but if they hit a steeper wall they will become stuck for a bit before jiggling loose (small ones do this too). Arrow shots to the top body will do little damage, however, like OoT, they have a weak root spot on their underside which is worth shooting. Every now and then they will try to quickly hover over you and dive with their blades pointed down. After that attack, they are buried in the ground like normal, giving Link a bit of time to attack on ground. However, they will spit out a bunch of little Peahats during this time. 5 or so for the medium one and 10-15 for the boss Peahat. Afterward, they ascend back into the sky for more. Upon death they drop large amounts of Peavar Cores, junk items, and several new two handed swords made from their blades. Maybe the medium Peahat drops one handed variants instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Tektites: Appear in three varieties: Red, Blue, and Black. Black ones are found on top of mountains. Red ones are found on top of Death Mountain. Blue ones are found floating on rivers and lakes. They like to jump pretty darn high. They drop a new junk item when killed along with a ""Tektite Tendon"". This is the tissue that helps them spring so high. Placing one on the ground creates a little spring-board that will push anything a decent amount. It will act about 3 times before it is destroyed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bunnies: I wish bunnies also existed. ;(

&amp;#x200B;

**---BOTW Roguelike Trials---**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss at what to call this. Help?

If one doesn't know what the term Roguelike means, look it up. It's a large genera of both new and old games. The three main tenets of a roguelike are: Permanent DEATH, Procedural/Random Generation, and a Progression in Relative Difficultly that the player must account for. A forth tenet could be the amazing unscripted interactions that can occur between mechanics in roguelikes, especially in classic-style roguelikes.

&amp;#x200B;

This trial sees Link travel down ONE HUNDRED floors in a format similar to the Trial of the Sword. Resting floors don't count in the number. This challenge can be accessed by going to the Coliseum Ruins and killing every enemy there. Once that happens, a Darknut emerges from the Malice along with several other corrupted monsters. Once they are defeated the malice in the Coliseum Ruins is removed and a special-looking shrine emerges from the ground...

The whole thing is framed as entertainment to the ""spectators"" in the Coliseum. Entering a new floor, Link would hear the ""audience"" shouting and rooting before fading out. Upon death and a return to the surface, Link would hear booing and jeering. ;( Perhaps a ghostly character of sorts is present to give you the challenge...

After clearing the Coliseum Ruins of enemies, they never spawn again.

Master Mode doesn't up the level of the monsters. Red monsters are common in the early floors. Monsters might not have regenerating health. 

&amp;#x200B;

**-PERMA DEATH-**

There are two main incentives to enter the trial, apart from fun and prestige- monetary reward, and a prize upon winning.

Accessing the shrine opens up a little menu that lets you assign how many rupees you want to bid. A 100 rupee starting bid is required but one can go higher. When one dies in the trial, Link does NOT lose 4 Spirit Orbs like he does in Master Mode+, only the money he bid.

Depending on how deep you make it into the trial you gain more rupees as a reward. You start at a loss before working your way to a profit. IDK how the mathematical model would work but I would say around floor 20-50 would see one break even. Lets say you earn 5% back per floor. You bet 100 rupees and make it to floor 20 and so have come even. So far the model has been linear, but after breaking even the model become cubic, allowing for much more money per floor.

HOWEVER, you can only cash-in at any resting floor. If you die at any non-resting floor you lose your bet even if you have made a profit. If you die at a resting floor, well that's just sad, you lose your money. You have to exit in a new way at the resting floor to claim your reward.

&amp;#x200B;

Exiting floor 100 gives you not only your money earned, but also a new item in normal gameplay- the Master Glider! It's a para-glider made with Sheikah technology. This allows you to ASCEND while using the glider. Pushing in on the left stick (maybe another button?) allows you to climb upward at about 40 degrees or so. Doing so however, will slowly reduce your rupees. (There has to be a little bit of a negative right?)

The roguelike trial can also be accessed from the main menu. However, the betting system doesn't exist and no reward is given apart from maybe a cool change to the main menu art. I would imagine this mode to be HOT with streamers, and they would appreciate the convenience.  

&amp;#x200B;

**-PROCEDURAL GENERATION-**

Resting floors exist in multiples of 5. These resting floors are not counted as part of the 100 floors and are labeled as ""Resting Floor 1"", ""Resting Floor 2"", etc.

Alternatively, sometimes you could only encounter resting floors after every 10 floors. For instance maybe resting floors are available after the following floors: 5,10,15,20,30,40,50,55,60,70,80,85,90. Whether the multiples of 5 rule is consistent or not, the availability of resting floors should always be the same. For instance in the above example, the player can always expect 10 floors to beat after floor 20 before a new resting floor is found.

The choice would have to be made if multiples of 5 are too easy relative to the difficultly scaling. I am leaning toward every multiple of 5.

&amp;#x200B;

**Level Themes**

Similar to the Trial of the Sword. Each grouping between resting floors carries the same Level Theme in every floor, randomized of course. Floor themes can occur multiple times in a playthrough. Some (harder) level themes only can appear after a certain amount of levels have been cleared. Other (easier) level themes might become impossible to encounter after a certain depth. Most of the level geometries from the Trial of the Sword are reused, with a far amount of new level designs made for each theme new and old. Note that the level generation doesn't create new level geometry designs, only augmenting the actors in the levels. Here is a list of the themes in the Trial of the Sword to be reused, along with new themes.

&amp;#x200B;

Forest

Water (some had wind in a direction)

Air Shrine (upward draft)

Dark Forest (with torches. Folded into Forest)

Shrine

Tropical (with thunderstorm)

Lava

Snow

Ruins Large (Horses spawn)

&amp;#x200B;

Desert (new)

Swamp (new. Mostly shallow water)

Mountainous (new)

Ocean (new. Large size. Less land)

Stone Pillars over water (new)

Stone Pillars over lava (new-ish)

Stone Pillars over bottomless pits (new)

Corrupted Shrine (new)

&amp;#x200B;

The first 5 levels are always Forest themed. The last 5 are always Corrupted Shrine themed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Level ""Feelings""**

In addition to the basic template these themes give us, ""level feelings"" (to use Spelunky's name for it) can be applied over the level or in some cases over the whole level set. For instance there can be a normal forest level template, but it is now dark, or raining, or there is an upward draft. This is an easy way to give each level or level set much more of a chance to be interesting and unique. There are exemptions to what ""feelings"" can be applied to certain level themes. For instance, ""Thunderstorm"" cannot be applied to the Lava level theme. Here is a list of ""level feelings"" that I thought of.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Dark (guarantees that Torches (or more rarely, Blue Torches) will spawn)

\-Torches (a assortment of predestined Burning Torch Stands appear in the level. These are always spawned in Dark level sets. However, they can still spawn in normal levels. They can give access to fire for arrows and such, and when you are lucky, they can give you warmth if they spawn in Snow/Cold levels. You can hop from torch to torch for warmth).

\-Blue torches (In BOTW RL, Blue Torches are cold. One can make weak ice arrows with them. And they can help stave of the heat. Heat resistance 1)

\-Upward Draft (guaranteed to appear in the Air Shrine level theme. Overall is a help to the player if he buys the Para-glider.

\-Sideways Draft

\-Rain

\-Thunderstorm

\-Sandstorm (only in Desert)

\-Blizzard (only in Snow. Requires 2 Cold resistance.)

\-Cold (only in Desert (Night) and Mountainous (Night). Guaranteed in Snow. Requires 1 cold resistance.)

\-Hot (only in Desert (Day). Guaranteed in Lava, and Stone Pillars over Lava. Requires 1 heat resistance.)

\-Sweltering Heat (only in Lava, requires 2 heat resistance)

\-Octo Platforms (most levels can have Octo Platforms appear in predestined locations. Enemies and chests appear on them. Banned in Dark levels.)

\-Night (different from Dark. Much brighter)

\-Day

\-Stal (mostly Stal enemies spawn. Only appears with Night.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**-Scaling Difficulty and Player Agency-**  

&amp;#x200B;

**The Directors**

Every level geometry has an assortment of predetermined vectors where enemies/crates/etc are allowed to spawn. There are two point pools used in determining the scaling difficultly. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""Antagonistic Director"" is given a pool of points and will spend them mostly on enemies. Let's say the evil director gets 10 points to spend on level 1. A Red Bokobllin costs 2 points. Giving the Red Bokblin a wooden club costs an additional point. Giving him a Boko-Bow costs an additional 3 points. ETC ETC. After ""buying"" the enemies. The evil director will place the enemies in appropriate locations designated by the devs so it doesn't cause glitches. Only Bow-carrying enemies will spawn on towers and such. For the next level the evil director would be given a larger pool of points and so on. The director is aware of level feelings, and will add or subtract his point pool depending on how beneficial or negative the level feeling is. Of course the evil director is incentivised to place monsters appropriate to the Level Theme. Some monsters are even banned from certain Level Themes.

&amp;#x200B;

Every floor that's a multiple of 10 guarantees a boss monster will spawn. More monsters can also spawn with it. Floor 100  spawns one of the four supped-up Blight Ganons. Along with some other enemies. Get rekt. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""Beneficial Director"" will be given a pool of points to help the player. This would include crates with food, arrows, and stuff like Octo-ballons, Peavar Cores\*, Tektite Tendons\*, Flint, Silk\*, and chu-chu jelly. Also, chests with weapons, shields, and bows. Many of these chests can be ""hidden"" in water or in the ground. Bomb kegs can be ""purchased"" by the director and spawned near places where enemies tend to spawn. Boulders. Magnetic objects. Weapons lying on/in the ground. And that's pretty much it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Resting Floors**

When starting the trial. Link is only given 3 heart containers, one wheel of stamina, the Shiekah-slate, and his underwear. He has NO runes, a default inventory size, and no Para-glider. The first level is guaranteed to spawn with some weapons lying around.

The player is able to save at any resting floor. After leaving the floor, the save is deleted.

Upon entering a Resting Floor the next Level Theme and any major Level Feelings are made known to the player. I first thought that the player should figure it out through context clues. Such as if dark levels are coming there would be multiple torches on the ground for Link to grab, etc. etc. However, I think it is more streamlined to have it just outright say/show it somewhere. You decide. 

Supplies appropriate to the next Level Theme/Feeling will be provided. The 3 chests still appear. Tropical fruit, among other things, can now spawn. Fairies DON'T spawn. ;(

Link is able to swap out is Usable Armor with his reserve armor at Resting Floors. 

Upon entering a floor Link is awarded 4, COUNT 'EM 4, Spirit Orbs. Perhaps they should be renamed, I'll just call them Orbs from now on. At every Resting Floor a new statue that looks like a conglomeration of a Goddess Statue, Cherry, and a Shiekah-slate pedestal is placed in the middle of the floor. This is where you spend Orbs and level up Link. I'll list the purchase options below:

(Note most prices probably need adjustments. This is just a rough guess as to their ideal price)

(Note that Link obtains a total of 400 Orbs if he makes it to level 100.)

(The cut-scenes for obtaining these items are vastly shortened/non-existent.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Heart Container: (4 Orbs) Doesn't heal Link fully. Only gives him one heart.

Stamina Container: (4 Orbs)

Para-glider: (8 Orbs) A critical purchase, especially depending on the next Level Theme.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapon Slot: (2 Orbs)

Bow Slot: (1 Orb)

Shield Slot: (1 Orb)

Armor Slot\*: (4 Orbs)

Meal Row\*: (2 Orbs)

&amp;#x200B;

Bombs: (10 Orbs) 

Square Bombs: (10 Orbs) Whatever is the second bomb type purchased will cost only 5 Orbs.

Bombs+: (8 Orbs) Upgrades both types of bombs.

Magnesis: (10 Orbs)

Statis: (16 Orbs) 

Statis+: (12 Orbs) 

Cryonis: (8 Orbs) Very useful for Water, Swamp, or Ocean level feelings.

Camera: (1 Orb) Pretty much useless. ;)

Amiibos are banned of course

&amp;#x200B;

Revali's Gale: (16 Orbs) Link is given one free use per floor. Each additional one costs 1 Orb. Many Octo-platforms will spill their chests into bottomless pits/lava. Revali's Gale might be the only way of accessing them.

Revali's Gale+: (20 Orbs) Link is given 3 free uses per floor.

Urboas's Fury: (30 Orbs) Every single use costs 1 Spirit Orb. One might want to turn it off in the menu.

Urboas's Fury+: (20 Orbs) One free use per level. :)

Daruk's Protection: (24 Orbs) One use per level. No purchases.

Daruk's Protection+: (20 Orbs) Three uses per level.

Mipha's Grace: (30 Orbs) Upon purchase Link will be revived (as normal with Mipha's Grace) once he loses all his hearts. However, this only works once and only once. Also, Link heals 3 hearts at the start of every floor. 

Mipha's Grace+: (30 Orbs) Essentially a refill. Link gets one more full heal on death for a max of 2. Also, Link heals 6 hearts per floor. Can only be purchased once. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fairy: (10 Orbs)

Arrows x10: (1 Orbs)

Elemental Arrows x5: (2 Orbs) Every type + Bomb arrows. 

Ancient Arrow: (4 Orbs) Remember you can kill pretty much anything with it in one shot. While pricey, buying one might save your skin. DON'T MISS!

&amp;#x200B;

High Tier Weapons: (X Orbs) Three weapons/shield/bows (that are high tier relative to the level you made it) can be purchased. They would be pretty pricey for what they are, but it could create some interesting decisions/strategies. Elemental swords and guardian weaponry would be pretty tempting.

Armor: (X Orbs) Three random armor pieces are available. Quite pricey but the player should invest in them at some point. There will always be at least one appropriate elemental armor piece for purchase when an elemental Level Theme is next. Armor cannot be found any other way.

Armor Upgrades: (X Orbs) Very, very pricey. Let's you upgrade your armor up to 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Hylian Shield: (20 Orbs) At the Resting Floor after level 50 and at that floor only, the player can choose to purchase the Hylian Shield.

&amp;#x200B;

Legendary Ancient Bow: (40 Orbs) At the Resting Floor after level 50 and at that floor only, the player can choose to purchase the Legendary Ancient Bow (different from the normal Ancient Bow). Every time you fire the bow, you spend one Orb and fire an Ancient Arrow. While costly, it is more cost-efficient than purchasing Ancient Arrows individually. It doesn't break. Maybe it also consumes a normal arrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Master Sword: (50 Orbs) At the Resting Floor after level 50 and at that floor only, the player can choose to purchase the Master Sword. The Master Sword has vastly reduced durability, losing its power in about 10-15 hits or so, however it regains its power every floor. It doesn't regain its power on a timer. Remember, It does double damage to Guardians, Malice-based enemies, and the final Blight Ganon boss.

Master Sword+: (10 Orbs Each) The Master Sword can be upgraded 3 times just like in the Trial of the Sword. It doesn't improve its durability however, only damage. This upgrade is available in every Resting Floor after the Master Sword is purchased. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy**

As one can see, the Resting Floor after floor 50 is pretty important. One can decide to save some Orbs so that they can purchase these very powerful items. Or they can forgo the risk and spend their Orbs in a more balanced way. 

I hope that many interesting decisions would arise while the player is in the Resting Floors: Should I purchase those warm pants? Should I purchase the flame sword for less Orbs? Should I just hope that the food/elixirs that I made stave of the cold until the next Resting Floor? Wait, the next five cold floors also have torches in them; I could run from torch to torch to stay warm. Then I would have enough to buy the Master Sword!

Each Orb price would hopefully be balanced so that there is no over-powered strategy. Also, due to the random levels and items in the shop, the player would have to adapt their strategy every run. Some seeds simply are not winnable if the player is determined to buy the Master Sword. ETC ETC. 

I didn't thoroughly crunch out the numbers, but I would want it to be impossible to obtain every power-up in the mode.

Levels 96-100 see Link obtaining Orbs with no store to spend them on. The player should consider buying something that uses Orbs to function.   

 

**---Conculsion---**

What do you guys think? These two modes make my mouth water. 

Any criticism? Other ideas? Could modding make this a reality?

truezelda,t3_ay3fai,"Groose, the forgotten Hero","It‚Äôs tragic that Groose is utterly forgotten to time by the people of Hyrule further down the timeline despite the important role he and his hair played.

For one Groose was instrumental in aiding Link and Zelda as he helped defeat the Very first calamity to befall Hyrule, demise with his contraption outside the sacred temple and rescuing unconscious  Zelda from what would‚Äôve been a fatal fall near the end of the game.

The thing about Groose is that although he comes off as an obnoxious Minor character in the beginning we can tell that Groose has the makings of a true hero. For one he genuinely cares for Zelda so much that he risks certain death by plummeting after link to search for her. Groose didn‚Äôt even come with any weapons or tools, he just desperately jumped from sky loft after link to try and rescue Zelda. 

Groose also takes pride in looking after Old Impa in the Temple, a task he reviled at first but soon comes to enjoy and is Heartbroken when he sees the Old Impa fade away at the end of the game, marking him out as a man with a heart of gold

On top of this Groose WASNT some legendary chosen hero by the goddess, **he was just some random normal dude who rose up to the challenge to play a part in this Grand set of events between Demise and Hylia all for the sake of a girl he Loved dearly but knew he couldn‚Äôt have; Zelda** while ending up helping the Hero Link defeat  Demise in battle

truezelda,t3_axuhe0,How the structure of the main quest could change in a successor to BotW.,"I really like Breath of the Wild, and I enjoyed its story quite a bit. However, I feel that the way the main quest was structured didn't fit particularly well with the free-form nature of the game. All four of the Divine Beast quests necessitate traveling to a specific location in the world, and then visiting one or two other locations in a linear sequence. The quests are very linear, and the player is told exactly where to go. They feel like a break from the exploration, rather than something that the player can naturally discover while out exploring.

Here's what changes to the structure of the main quest I would propose:

*Note: I'll be referring to Shrines for the sake of brevity, but keep in mind that Shrines could be replaced with other types of mini dungeons that serve the same general purpose. 

---

Have the conflict of each main quest affect a variety of different locations in the region, rather than just a single town. There could be an array of stables, outposts, trading posts, and other small settlements. The player could learn about details of the main quest in each of these locations. So the stable system of BotW would be expanded upon to make the smaller settlements dotted around the map relevant to the story. I would also propose replacing a number of enemy camps with settlements that have been overrun by monsters that you need to liberate. Essentially, there would be a miniature kingdom that each main quest scenario takes place in. The player would learn about the conflict from different characters, piecing together the story as they explore. 

The main quest could involve completing a variety of different objectives around each Mini Kingdom, alongside one significant objective for each that you'll be working towards (which would be a challenging dungeon). Objectives could include stuff like liberating settlements, saving captured NPCs, opening up trade routes, retrieving important items, defeating troublesome monsters, and helping out the people of the Kingdom in various ways. The players would be able to work on these objectives even before they learn about the conflict in the Kingdom, so basic exploration would help towards progress in the story. Shrine Quests and Shrines could be directly relevant to the story. Imagine combat Shrines being replaced by enemy forts with captured NPCs that you need to rescue. Normal NPCs could give you Spirit Orbs instead of the Sheikah Monks. 

The increased prevalence of story in mini dungeons and general exploration would require the devs to put more time into writing dialogue, it would require implementing a larger variety of small settlements, and it may require having a larger number of NPCs in the world. But aside from that, I don't think it would be terribly difficult to implement a lot of these ideas. It mainly requires recontextualizing a lot of the stuff that the player would be doing. Shrines and Shrine Quests could have objectives that actually tie into the story and allow the player to make some type of permanent change to the world. Defeating a group of enemies in the world could be made to feel meaningful. And players could engage with the story at the same time as they explore the world.

truezelda,t3_ay1jno,The Sagas of Zelda," 

So, the Zelda timeline could use some work. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with the Zelda fandom recently, so maybe that‚Äôs not much of an opinion anymore, but the three-pronged timeline is a bit awkward, as well as the placing of a few titles such as Four Sword Adventures and Breath of the Wild. So after some brainstorming, I thought of a way that I think would be a cool way to tie in each game with each other. So instead of a single timeline, I could see them grouping certain games together that have similar themes. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was inspired by a post I remember seeing a few years ago regarding Breath of the Wild and how it references the other games. I‚Äôm just gonna call it the Myth theory since I don‚Äôt remember where I saw it, but it was similar to the ‚Äúsame legend retold‚Äù theory that existed back in the days before we had a canon Zelda timeline. Essentially, the Myth theory goes that the backstory of certain locations and artifacts are canon in the Zelda games they‚Äôre found in, but the story of the Goddesses‚Äô Chosen Hero saving the princess is just a oral storytelling formula. So Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds, the ruins that we see of it in BoTW, is the same Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds we see in Twilight Princess, although the story of Link saving Zelda and Midna might be just a storytelling formula.

&amp;#x200B;

But I digress, I think that instead of a timeline, Nintendo could make something like a list of sagas of certain Zelda games that have a certain theme shared between them. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, something like a ‚ÄúStory of the Gods Saga‚Äù would include A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Skyward Sword. Preferably in that order, as this would also try to keep the games in chronological order as to keep the experience between each one smooth. ALttP would explain some of the Triforce and Sacred Realm, while OoT would go more in depth and into the Goddesses, and Skyward Sword would go full ham and give the rest of the details about Hylia, the Master Sword, and the beginning of Hyrule, while still offering a complete gameplay experience from one to the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

A similar saga could be ‚ÄúRise and Fall of Hyrule Saga‚Äù which includes Ocarina of Time, Skyward Sword, and then Breath of the Wild. OoT sets up the story about Hyrule, the Triforce, the Goddesses, and the Link/Zelda/Ganon dynamic, while SS elaborates on it to give more insight, and then BoTW rounds out the saga by subverting what was established in SS and shows how that cycle of hatred affects Hyrule so far in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another saga that I think is a bit on the weird side is the ‚ÄúForgotten Hero Saga‚Äù in which Majora‚Äôs Mask would come before Ocarina of Time, which leads directly into Twilight Princess. I know that MM is a sequel to OoT, however, I feel as if it could work as the beginning of the saga? We see the Hero of Time at his lowest, searching for a friend and getting lost in a parallel world, and the theme of this game is healing and moving forward. We then see his origin of sorts in Ocarina of Time, how he became the hero he is, and this gives us immediate context into Twilight Princess, which wraps up the story of the Hero of Time and introduces a new hero that can defeat Ganon. Also something something TP Link has close connections with the people around him so he's the only one that can truly bring the Hero of Time's lonely spirit to rest. His friends also don't disappear after beating Ganon. But yeah, there‚Äôs obviously a lot of extrapolation of subtext and your mileage may vary, but I think it‚Äôs a fun idea that doesn‚Äôt need to restrain Nintendo to a timeline. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other sagas could include:

&amp;#x200B;

Grand Voyage

WW -&gt; PH -&gt; ST

&amp;#x200B;

Adventures of Link

Z1 -&gt; Z2 -&gt; ALttP -&gt; LA -&gt; OoX -&gt; ALBW -&gt; TH

&amp;#x200B;

Four Swords Adventures

MC -&gt; FS -&gt; FSA

&amp;#x200B;

ALttP -&gt; ALBW

&amp;#x200B;

OoT -&gt; WW

&amp;#x200B;

SS -&gt; TP

&amp;#x200B;

ALttP -&gt; LA -&gt; OoX

&amp;#x200B;

Z1 -&gt; BoTW

&amp;#x200B;

(I feel like these are a bit obvious)

&amp;#x200B;

Winds of Change  
WW -&gt; MC 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if this one is similar to WW -&gt; ST, because while MC takes place in a location called Hyrule, it still offers a new lore for the land, its sword, and main villain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Using this structure, there doesn‚Äôt need to be one story about the Master Sword, for example. Heck, if not for Miyamoto upending the tea table, so to speak, we would have something similar to this with the timeline. Four Swords Adventure would have been the prequel to A Link to the Past, so the entire Downfall Timeline would have just been a separate saga, with MC, FS, and FSA leading into ALttP. 

&amp;#x200B;

And of course the official timeline could be its own saga. I just think it would be cool to be able to have multiple stories/origins about series mainstays, like maybe including an entirely new pantheon or re-purposing old dungeons and making them new again. Newer games can take multiple ideas from different timelines, like having a top down Zelda game that takes place in the Great Sea that also references stuff from Majora‚Äôs Mask, creating a few new potential sagas. 

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah. That‚Äôs just an idea I was tossing around the other day. I find it less limiting than a traditional timeline, but still ties games together and opens up more discussion and interpretation about how some can tie into each other. Plus, it encourages replaying certain games back-to-back. Any thoughts?",2,public,,0

truezelda,t3_axeerp,Link‚Äôs Loneliness and why it would make sense/work to put a Skyrim styled follower system in the next big open world Zelda.,"As it was posted earlier, Link tends to be super lonely and everybody he meets ends up leaving him. Honestly, it truly is sad. And although it‚Äôs his belief to take the entire weight of the worlds problems on HIS shoulders; i still hate not seeing the guy smile. His spirit deserves unending happiness and friendship. 

So I ask, how would you guys feel about a Zelda game with the follower system of Skyrim? Recruit, give them weapons/armor. Make dungeons work with the system (obviously make them still complete-able while being solo). But I feel it would be nice to have some fully voiced NPCs fighting alongside of our hero. 

I find it... weird that people who are super eager to save Hyrule (Sidon, Teba, etc...) would just help out once and say, ‚ÄúOkay hero you‚Äôre on your own!‚Äù I believe that a lot more people would be drawn to help Link out. It‚Äôs a very Natural tendency in life from wild animals to civilized humans; that we follow and support people we look up to. (Off topic but hear me out) People died marching behind MLK, people died supporting him and his beliefs/missions. Lions follow the strongest cat in the Pride for protection, adventure and because they want to earn their place.

Who‚Äôs to say that Hylians, a race that‚Äôs known to have people give up their lives for the Royal Army, wouldn‚Äôt see Link and ask ‚ÄúHey, let me help you. I lend you my (insert whatever capabilities they have) but please, my family was wiped out by Ganon. I wish nothing more than to help you defeat him. Even if Links character says ‚ÄúNo sorry. (Because Link cares about the lives of others more than himself and believes it‚Äôs HIS responsibility alone and no one else‚Äôs).  In Lord of the Rings all the races put their hatred and beliefs aside for the greater good and to defeat one common enemy. In Naruto all the hidden villages set aside their differences and politics to join forces to defeat Madara/Zetsus army. 

It‚Äôs just a natural tendency to help those who believe in you and your missions. And on the other hand there‚Äôs those who grow up in pain and suffering, see the power Ganon beholds, and then watches as one man obliterates everything that put that person in hell. Next thing you know they swear their loyalty to Ganon because they feel their revenge through Ganon. And of course, Ganon‚Äôs Demons. 

So, all in all, a max party of 3 maybe 4 would work perfectly for an open world Zelda game. (IMO) And I would love to see Link make these friendships throughout the series. They don‚Äôt even have to be any normal NPC, they can be programmed to be on your team forever just because that‚Äôs the way the game is. Next thing you know; You, Linkle, Zelda and some guy Links age or younger using a sword and shield like Link takes arms with you because you‚Äôre his hero. Go through Hyrule leveling up, making friends, have a revive system, (obviously Nintendo or Zelda is big on people just getting slaughtered and laying dead in the middle of the floor for you to look at). I think it‚Äôd be great, and hopefully, we‚Äôd get to see our boy Smile and not be so lonely anymore. ",85,public,,0

Not all of these ideas could work, perhaps none of them could, but why not have a bit of a creative writing excersize instead of studying?

---

**Metroid Prime**

* Scanning

I've barely played Metroid Prime, but having a scanning system that lets me scan objects or enemies in the environment and gives me in-game hints (where to go next, this enemy has a weakness) and small lore dumps is awesome. The Shiekah Slate would be a natural fit for this. 

**Resident Evil 4**

* Adaptive difficulty

This mechanic is actually hidden from the player and wasn't discovered until years later. Essentially, the game judges how well you are or aren't doing based on the number of enemies you've killed compared to how many times you're dying. If you're doing well, it spawns more enemies and they drop less gold and ammo. The opposite if you're killing more and dying less. This might be trickier to implement into an open-world title but it would really help curve the game's difficulty better. 

**Hollow Knight**

* The Metroidvania genre

If they were to ever revisit Zelda II, or perhaps elements of Zelda II, Nintendo should take notes form Team Cherry.  Notably,a 2D Metroidvania, but incorporating classic Zelda dungeons and items would be a unique twist on the usual 2D top-down Zeldas and still keep it distinct from 2D Metroids. Although I've never played a Metroid game extensively, so Metroid fans feel free to expand on this idea or argue against it

* A simple plot, a silent protagonist, and lore

The plot of Hollow Knight is kept simple and able to flow naturally despite the protagonist being silent. Most of the story is hidden within the lore, which is given by item descriptions and NPC dialogue and environmental story-telling.

* Hand-drawn assets (as opposed to pixel-art)

Hollow Knight's visuals are distinct from most other indie-games in that it features hand-drawn assets, as opposed to pixel art. This would be a great chance for the Zelda team(s)to once again shine through with yet another art-style, as they've been known to do for decades. 

**Persona 5**

* Character portraits in dialogue, voice-acted non-cutscene dialogue, and dialogue-options

I'd like to focus on Persona 5's dialogue sequences, which might be a nice fit for top-down Zeldas for non-cutscene dialogue sequences. 3D cutscene dialogue sequences. In Persona 5, you have hand-drawn character's heads with readable dialogue that is sometimes voice-acted, or simply has short expressions like ""Yeah!"" or ""Hey!"" or ""C'mon man!"" or, most famously, ""For real?!"" (Ryuji is best boy and anyone who says otherwise is getting banned). The Zelda series has always had grunts that help define even the most unimportant NPC, so adding character portraits on top of that could really help give even more charm. Additionally, Persona 5's protagonist Joker is a pseudo-silent protagonist, who, like Link, does actually speak, but in-game we rarely hear his voice. Yet we're able to choose various dialogue options anyway, some trivial, others more important, Breath of the Wild inched towards this more than most previous titles, but it would be nice to see more variety in dialogue options. 

**God of War (2018)**

I've only put a few hours into this game, but it does a few interesting things: 

* NPC lore-dumps while traversing the overworld

There's a boat mechanic that you'll often use for transit between locations, and this NPC will tell you stories of Norse myths. Something like this might be cool while riding horseback or on the seas, and the Shiekah Slate, if returning in some form, could act as a cell-phone or have pre-recorded messages that trigger once you reach certain locations or trigger when traveling on foot when no enemies are around and you're travelling through the world. the Pirate's Charm from Wind Waker could also work if they don't want to reuse Shiekah tech again. Or maybe just give you a companion that easily follows you around like Navi, Tatl, Ezlo, Midna or Fi could do the same. Midna already has unique dialogue options for every room in a dungeon, so its not like its unprecedented.

* Cooldowns on special abilities during combat.

This makes combat much more engaging to me, especially on higher difficulties, as it requires mastery of timing and knowing when to use certain abilities. Breath of the Wild already has this in the form of Champion Abilities, but I'd rather see Hidden Skills come back with higher damage and cool-down times to balance them out. 

* Having a story built around a pantheon of deities

In God of War, as is series tradition, the gods of the realm play a large role in your story and are very active both as protagonists and antagonists. A Zelda story centered around the various strange creatures, and lesser and greater deities would be a cool idea to explore. The Minish Cap is the closest we've gotten to this, so if several races and deities were to play as large of a role as the Picori, it would make things very interesting.

**Dark Souls**

* Stamina is drained from combat

An obvious comparison, as Dark Souls took influence form Ocarina of Time. Many clamor for a Dark Souls Zelda, and I know its not a wholly popular idea, but at least one title that experiments with stamina used in combat would be interesting. In addition to the usual sword-swings draining stamina, having side-stepping and back-flipping to dodge use stamina like in Bloodbourne would be much more active. You could also incorporate items into combat, and have them use more stamina for a larger bursts of damage. For example, a fully charged arrow would do a lot more damage, but at the cost of using more stamina. Using the ball-and-chain would be a one-shot for lesser enemies, but at the cost of a huge chunk of your stamina. It might also give more weight to the decision between health and stamina. 

* Corpse-runs

Actually the mechanic I like the least in Soulsbourne, but I figure I'd write about it anyway. What if instead of collecting EXP of some kind - Souls in Dark Souls, Blood Echoes in Bloodbourne - you lost some of your items and had to retrieve them off your corpse instead? This might actually be a terrible idea, as you might be locked into a region without retrieving your items/weapons, but I'm just spit balling. Alternatively, you could lose all your Rupees, like how you loose all your Geo in Hollow Knight.

**Bloodbourne**

* Rally

Bloodbourne has to be one of my GOATs despite its issues, and I particularly love it for its active combat. In my opinion, the best mechanic in the game is Rally. Essentially, when you git hit, you have a certain amount of time to recover that portion of your health from an enemy by hitting them enough times. Each hit restores a part of your health that the enemy hit took away. Take too long and that opportunity to restore that portion of your health goes away. This is incredibly important in faster-paced boss-fights, and might lend itself to a more aggressively focused combat system.

* Blood Vials

Blood Vials are items that heal short bursts of health in real time. You have a lot of them, and you can pick them off of enemies, which further encourages you to fight instead of running away form or past enemies. Breath of the Wild's food system entirely broke combat, especially in the mid to late game when you could tank more hits. Maybe limiting the player to a few edible raw ingredients to heal a few hearts at a time while in combat would better balance things.

**Kingdom Hearts III**

* Unique mechanics in each world

While I actually think this is one of Kingdom Hearts III's biggest flaws due to how little the mechanics are fleshed out, each world you visit has unique mechanics that help distinguish it from other worlds. In one world, you have giant mecha-battles. In another, you can have giant ship battles. In another still, you play a few iterations of a mini-game. In *Breath of the Wild*, the reason we mostly remember Zora's Domain, and to a lesser extent, the Yiga Hideout, is because they were unique departures form the usual gameplay loop. They forced the player to play the game differently by placing mechanical restrictions of you. Something mechanically different in each region of the next Zelda game would keep things fresh.

**Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots**

* Skin-tight tunics revealing Link's nicely shaped ass

You think I'm joking? 

* *Sense* ring

There was a little ring around Snake that showed how much noise he was making while moving. It used the usual bars to indicate volume, so you could easily tell when sneaking around when you needed to be slower and quieter. I'd much prefer this to BotW's noise meter on Normal mode for the HUD. Much cleaner and easier to use as you can keep your focus on the center of the screen where you're playing instead of glancing to the side. 

**DOOM (2016**

* Glory-kills

You can get a little burst of health form finishing off foes with a melee kill. Very high-risk, high reward, especially in higher difficulty modes. Having some sort of special ending blow to give you a bit of health, provided the food system is balanced, would be a good option to consider.

truezelda,t3_axu33p,The real life eras of the Zelda series (based on general fan reception),"I notice a lot that most fans' defining Zelda game is within a certain time period where said games were practically released one after the other. Also, that a lot of fans' least favorite Zelda game was in another period where said games were practically released one after the other.

So after some analysis, I attempted to organize the Zelda games into distinct ""eras"" based on their general reception and perception of quality.

**Stone Age (1986-1987)**: Fans respect this era for beginning the series, though often acknowledge its being archaic, particularly in regards to being overly cryptic and hiding secrets in overly obscure areas.

* Zelda 1

* Adventure of Link

**Golden Age (1991-2000)**: Most older fans' favorite game is one of these games. They are generally considered to be the high point of the series, whether individually or collectively.

* A Link to the Past

* Link's Awakening

* Ocarina of Time

* Majora's Mask

**Silver Age (2001-2004)**: The era with the games that people seem to talk about the least. Most will agree that this era's games are solid-to-great, but overall the games in this area as a whole isn't quite as acclaimed the preceding era or hated as the succeeding era.

* Oracle of Ages

* Oracle of Seasons

* Four Swords

* Wind Waker

* Four Swords Adventures

* The Minish Cap

**Dark Age (2006-2011)**: Most fans' least favorite game is one of these games. These games are, individually or not, generally considered the weakest in the series. They certainly have their fans, though, mostly those who were introduced to the series in or close to this era.

* Twilight Princess

* Phantom Hourglass

* Spirit Tracks

* Skyward Sword

**Post-Dark Age (2013-2015)**: A duo of 3DS games marking a transition out of the Dark Age. One game returns the series to its more open, story-light roots, the other is a rather shallow imitation of two Silver Age titles.

* A Link Between Worlds

* Tri Force Heroes

**New Era (2017-current)**: It's too early to call, but BotW intends to usher in a new era of the series. On one side, fans consider it a return to form of what they like about the series. On the other, fans consider it too much of the sacrifice of what they like about the series.

* Breath of the Wild

truezelda,t3_awhdse,The statues of Ocarina of Time 3D's Castle Courtyard,"Imgur album [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ekKkXYS) for reference. 

In light of getting access to tools that are a secret to everyone, I thought I'd investigate the statues as that's been the biggest thing haunting me about Ocarina's lore for years. 

**The first statue - the Hero of Men?**

A few interesting things. First, we see the central figure is most likely a man. He seems to be in his 30s, I'd estimate, maybe even older - as high as 50s, given the prominence of his cheekbones. Its hard to tell due to the low-poly count but he might also have a beard as well. He appears to be wearing decorative armor, His armor is definitely different from the normal garb worn by Hyrulean Knights [for reference](https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1487/40/1487402100528.png). Lastly, and most importantly, is his sword: it lacks a hilt, which is really peculiar.

So, what to make of it? As the title for this section suggests, its possible he's the Hero of Men, but older. Why?

The strongest correlation I have is his hair-style. I know, Iknow. Hear me out. In *The Minish Cap*'s opening cinematic, we see a stain-glass representation of the [Hero of Men](https://imgur.com/gallery/bQLdhpD). Note their thick blond locks have a very flat appearance.

There is evidence beyond appearance, however:

&gt;  ""A long, long time ago...when the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow...The tiny Picori appeared from the sky, bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light."" ‚Äî Prologue (The Minish Cap)

&gt; ""Long, long ago, and then even longer before that...Evil creatures appeared in the world of humans. They were powerful, frightening beasts, and they created such trouble! But then the Picori came from the sky, bringing humans powerful magic. With the magic light force and the Picori Blade, the beasts were repelled. And the world of humans once more knew peace, thanks to the Picori."" ‚Äî Marshall (The Minish Cap)

&gt;  ""With wisdom and courage, the hero drove out the darkness. When peace had been restored, the people enshrined that blade with care. And the force of the golden light, embodied in Hyrule's princess, shone forth upon the lands."" ‚Äî Stained-glass window (The Minish Cap)

From the background we have on the Bound Chest War, we know the Hero of Men used the Picori Blade and Light Force to vanquish the demon horde, and the blade was sealed away in the Bound Chest. 

We know, thanks to Marshall, that there were scholars who studied and passed down the legend of the Picori and the Bound Chest to the point that there were ceremonies held. 

This legend has no confirmed placement in the timeline, I would guess that it takes place towards the end of the Era of Chaos, and sparks the Era of Prosperity. The reasoning being that the Era of Chaos was presumably a time with many different factions fighting for the Triforce on the Surface, before Hyrule Kingdom was established. Perhaps the Picori's gift of the Light Force was just what Hylians and freindly races needed to drive off invading forces, along with the help of a Hero wielding the Picori Blade. Much like the use of the Triforce in the Downfall Timeline to bring Hyrule into prosperity,m perhaps the Light Force had the same effect.

Such a Hero would very well be remembered for bringing peace after such a long era of chaos. Perhaps we could go so far as to speculate he has even the first to found Hyrule, even it's first King. Though we have hardly any evidence - certainly no direct evidence -to support this. 

There are some rebuttals to be had:

1) Why does he appear older as the statue? He looks at least 30, if not 50, as you speculated. Yet the murals depict him as younger, a teenager at most.  

We must remember there are centuries, if not millenniums, between titles and even events between titles. Thus we can factor in the natural distortion that comes with legends - perhaps over time the Hero of Men became older to suit his title, implying maturity. Photography hadn't been invented yet, after all, and thus word of mouth is the only thing to go on. This also wouldn't be the first time in-universe a Hero ahs become distorted. In [The Wind Waker](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/e/ee/Hero_of_Time_Statue.png) we see the Hero of Time's statue does not accurately represent what he looked like as an adult. 

2) Why not depict him with the Picori Blade? He appears to be wielding a very different blade.

This is a good counter-argument, and one I don't have a definitive answer to. My best rebuttal is that a) we can again argue distortion, and b) we know the Picori Blade was the key to lock and seal away the demons inside the chest, so perhaps he carried about a different sword later on that was iconic or c) it's simply the artist's representation.

3)Why the ceremonial armor and not the green tunic he wore during his heroics?

It is my belief this may have been ceremonial armor he wore for special occasions alter in life, or was buried with this ceremonial armor a la the [Hero of Time](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/4/4b/Twilight_Princess_Artwork_Hero%27s_Shade_%28Concept_Art%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20160606151222).

**The second statue - a young Rauru?** 

[My progress thus far](https://youtu.be/g3iFJpGJiug?t=15)

I have no idea who this guy could be. Perhaps a scholar, or wise men, or priest? Another Ancient Sage? My best guess is a young Rauru, but if that's the case he should probably have the Light Symbol on his pedestal, no?

This could also be a young King Hyrule of this era, or perhaps an Era past. But literally all three King Hyrules we've seen in-game look very similar, so unless this one died at a young age, I don't think he passes. He also would probably bear the Royal crest on his pedestal. 

I can update my Imgur album with closer shots of the statue at different angles. Note much like the first statue, you can't see the back of it due to [culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-face_culling).

truezelda,t3_awda92,"It seems the more they (make an effort to) flesh out swordplay, the less useful items are in combat, and vice versa","I was looking back on [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/9lgi8b/the_idea_that_items_have_to_be_puzzle_solvers_and/?sort=confidence) that I made four months ago, and there was [one comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/9lgi8b/the_idea_that_items_have_to_be_puzzle_solvers_and/e76jrj2/) that tickled my mind:

&gt;I think the only problem was that later classic 3D Zeldas like TP and SS focused a lot on Link's sword combat (especially the latter), so they ended up not giving much thought how the player would use the items in combat. 

This made me think: it really does feel like they did sacrifice the usefulness of items in combat to prop up the swordplay around the late GCN/GBA era and the Wii era. While Minish Cap merely built upon certain moves that could be done in earlier games, it remains the 2D game with the most fleshed-out sword combat, having the Pegasus Dash Attack, Spin Attack, Sword Beam, and Great Spins of old, while adding the Roll Attack and adapting the Downward Thrust to top-down gameplay. However, items like the Gust Jar, Cane of Pacci, and lantern have a very ""only on specific enemy"" use in combat. Twilight Princess outright forgoes the usefulness of items in combat, bow aside, but it definitely took the sword skills in previous games like Minish Cap to the next level. You got more control over the Back Slice and Helm Splitter from Wind Waker, can stab out of a roll, you got the charged Jump Strike and Mortal Draw, and most importantly, you can *run while slashing*. Skyward Sword is horribly egregious with the ""only on specific enemy"" use with combat items, but was the last Zelda game as of yet to feature the directional slash mechanic, and remains the only game to really build on it. SS even reworked the Spin Attack to be a heavy attack to the regular slash's light attack, introduced the parry, and retained the Ending Blow from TP.

A Link Between Worlds scaled back on the sword skills, but really did the items good in this game. Not only is every one good in combat with a unique use, they can all be upgraded to be even better; though as a sacrifice, the only sword skill in the game other than the usual Pegasus Dash Attack and Spin Attack is the Great Spin from TP. BotW also scaled back on the swordplay to bring the items back into prominence after its 3D predecessors, though just enough to make a happy medium. The Runes are fun to use in combat at first, even though they don't do much on enemies not too long into the game. We don't have things like the ending blow, back slice, helm splitter, roll attack, or even ""run while slash"", but we still had the parry, the sneakstrike as a sort of ending blow substitute, and the Flurry Rush.  

Still, I think they can stand to really merge the usefulness of items with a lot more variety in swordplay. I would even like it if every item that isn't the bow just stuns or immobilizes enemies in some way. That alone would give items more of a point without having to step on the toes of sword skills.",24,public,,0
truezelda,t3_awaojf,The Weakness of the Yiga Clan and its contribution to Breath of the Wild's Antagonist Problem,"It is not a controversial position in many corners  of the Zelda fanbase, this sub included, to hold that Calamity Ganon fails as an antagonist because of his lack of personality.  After all, a natural disaster may be capable of creating circumstances in which an engaging story may be told, but such an impersonal entity cannot bear the burden of supporting a narrative on its own.  The story it sets up must be filled with interesting characters if it wants to captivate its audience.

I do not believe that the fault for Breath of the Wild's antagonist issues lies solely on Calamity Ganon's miasmic shoulders, however.  In fact, many well regarded stories have used similarly characterless antagonists to great effect.   Dragon Age: Origins comes to mind with its mindless Archdemon and Darkspawn hordes providing ample narrative impetus to carry its main plot.  The Witcher 3 as well is a story that is primarily devoted towards preventing a natural disaster, The White Frost, from devouring all life in the world.  Both of these games have stories that are universally beloved, but what element do they share that allows them to avoid Breath of the Wild's narrative misstep?  **Compelling secondary antagonists**.  

In addition to the various villains of the game's side arcs, Dragon Age Origins has one of the most interesting villains among Western RPGs, Teyrn Loghain Mac Tir.  Loghain serves as an effective foil to the player's Warden avatar, with his own political and emotional baggage and biases that make him an interesting character to vye against in your efforts to save Fereldan from the Archdemon.  Loghain in many ways *is* the game's main antagonist, despite the fact that the Blight is the core problem the player is attempting to solve.  Similarly, in The Witcher 3, the player is constantly being pit against villains with tangible personality and character depth during Geralt's quest to locate his daughter and stop the White Frost.  While the primary villain Eredin is admittedly not the most interesting character, there are other villains like King Radovid of Redania that are compelling and nuanced enough to serve as effective adversaries for the player to want to overcome.  The presence of these secondary villains ultimately allow Origins and The Witcher to have main plots focused on combating impersonal entities without suffering from the problem of uninteresting antagonists.

Which of course, brings us to the elephant in the room.  In the absence of a human Ganondorf with his own desires, personality, and ambitions, the narrative duty of creating an interesting antagonistic force for Link to overcome belonged to the traitorous Yiga Clan.  It is my belief that the Yiga Clan decisively failed to carry this burden and the result is that the player feels uninvested in the conflict, in a similar way that playing chess against a computer (or even a real person that's just a bore) is a far less interesting activity than playing against an individual with whom one has a strong relationship.  The primary reason for the Yiga's failure I feel is that they are:

a)  **Devoid of threat**.  The game uniformly treats the Yiga not as a dark disturbing cult in the vein with the Dark Interlopers of Twilight Princess but rather as bumbling, banana-guzzling buffoons.  The player is encouraged not to fear the Yiga Clan but to laugh at them, and because of this the player cannot respect them as adversaries.   Even Master Koga, the Clan's long-foreshadowed leader, is an immense disappointment when the player finally encounters him.  He carries himself as a bumbling idiot and the player cannot help but lose any respect for him as an antagonist.  Now there is nothing inherently wrong with a goofy antagonist, but here it is tonally dissonant.  Breath of the Wild largely takes its main plot very seriously and Koga is the only human face we have to associate with the antagonist of said plot, yet he is at odds with its high stakes and dark presentation.

b)  **Devoid of character depth**.  Ask yourself this question, why does Koga serve Ganon?  Why do the rest of the Yiga Clan? 
Perhaps I am simply misremembering and we are given a motivation but if so it could not have been especially memorable one.  Certainly nothing akin to the enmity the player is shown between Zant and Midna which provides context for why he would want to seize power, or the pseudo-philosophical melancholy of Wind Waker Ganondorf that defines his desire to resurrect Hyrule.  This point in particular is where I feel the rest the series shines above Breath of the Wild, I can think of no other main Zelda antagonists that have been so vacuously characterized as Koga and his followers.  Even villains that were simple in goal like Ghirahim had the charisma to engage the player, the Yiga Clan has nothing to offer by comparison.

**And they are the only antagonists with any meaningful character in the entire game.**

Future games in the Downfall Timeline may continue to use Ganon as a mindless beast.  There is nothing necessarily wrong with this choice as long as in the future Ganon is supplemented with compelling secondary antagonists.  If not, I fear those disappointed with his use in Breath of the Wild will have little to look forward to.


Edit:  There have been some good objections in the comments, I encourage others to read them as I forgot a few relevant details, though I do believe my point still stands.


Edit 2:  I feel it may be worth clarifying that the reason I am singling out Koga and the Yiga Clan in particular is that they are the only antagonists capable of higher thought.   The game desperately needs a secondary antagonist with a fleshed out personality that can directly interact with Link.  The only candidates for this position in the main game are the Yiga, particularly Koga, but they are incompetent in this role.  Breath of the Wild‚Äôs narrative would have been improved if Koga had stepped up to the role of secondary antagonist or if a new character had been written in that could do so.",38,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aw7lz1,Theory: Skyloftians eat bugs.,"Bear with me, I‚Äôm quite serious and I think the evidence is in my favor.

So some time ago, I became consumed with a question: What do they eat in Skyloft??? Pumpkins, obviously, but‚Ä¶ what else? One squash plant does not a balanced diet make.

Assuming Skyloft is larger than we see represented in-game (which it would really have to be, to support a human population for hundreds or thousands of years), it seems reasonable to suggest that pumpkins aren‚Äôt their only crop. Its altitude makes Skyloft less-than-ideal for agriculture, but there are plants that could be cultivated. [Per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_cuisine), buckwheat, millet, naked barley, common beans, high-altitude rice, and potatoes are all grown in the Himalayas, making them good candidates for Skyloft as well. So they likely have veggies, starch, grains, etc.

But what about meat? Skyloft doesn‚Äôt seem to have any livestock. While, again, there‚Äôs probably more to Skyloft than we see represented in-game, livestock generally requires large amounts of land to support, and Skyloft doesn‚Äôt have much to spare. And to be honest, if they do keep goats, pigs, sheep, etc., it seems odd that we wouldn‚Äôt see even a single hint of one in the game. The Zelda Encyclopedia (not an ironclad source, I know) echoes some of these assumptions, stating that ‚Äúbecause Skyloft has very little land, large animals like cows are not present there.‚Äù

There‚Äôs not a lot of wild fauna about, either. Which makes sense, given that the sky is not so much a real ecosystem as a divine structure meant to hide humanity from Demise and his armies. The only animals around, other than Loftwings (which, y‚Äôknow, really don‚Äôt seem to be on the menu), are Remlits, which are kept as pets and therefore unlikely to be eaten, and the few birds that can fly high enough.

They can probably hunt the wild birds, but that doesn‚Äôt strike me as a reliable food source to be put on the table three times a day‚Äîit‚Äôs a lot of effort for small amounts of meat. 

In general, Skyloft seems to be similar to many historical cultures, where meat was an occasional treat and not a regular staple. But those societies still generally kept livestock, meaning milk, butter, eggs, and so forth‚Äîthings Skyloft probably doesn‚Äôt have. On the other hand, most of the Himalayan crops mentioned above actually do have high protein content. Is that enough? I don‚Äôt know because I‚Äôm not a dietician. I do question the idea of a medieval society that is essentially vegan, though. Are pumpkins and barley really all these people eat?? I don‚Äôt know about you all, but I find that hard to swallow (pun retroactively intended).

But there is one other resource that Skyloft has in abundance: [bugs](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Bug#Skyward_Sword).

[Entomophagy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomophagy), or the human practice of eating bugs, may seem like a bizarre, niche thing in the West, since it‚Äôs taboo in North America and Europe, but insect-eating is common to cultures in most parts of the world, and eighty percent of the world's nations eat insects. The UN estimates that about 2 billion people worldwide consume insects. [Leviticus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11&amp;version=NIV) in the Old Testament literally has passages specifying which bugs are kosher. Basically, the Western distaste for bugs is an outlier, not the norm.

On average, [bugs are about 75% protein](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/eating-bugs), comparable to animal protein sources. More importantly, in many cultures where other sources of nutrition are relatively scarce, bugs aren‚Äôt just a snack, but [a dietary staple](https://travel.usnews.com/features/countries_that_eat_bugs). Sounds an awful lot like Skyloft to me! 

We know people in Skyloft [catch and raise bugs](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Bug_Rock)‚Äîwhy not eat them? [They already use them](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Bug#Skyward_Sword) in the potions they drink. 

In conclusion, SS Link does not drink milk (and would in fact be lactose intolerant) and instead eats fried crickets, have a nice day.

P.S.: There‚Äôs lots of great pictures in that Wikipedia entomophagy article, aren‚Äôt there? You‚Äôre welcome. I have suffered for my art.

*What I actually like is being rewarded. Breath of the Wild is fucking empty. It never rewards you for basically anything, ever, and when it does the rewards are piss, purposefully so. Opening up an opal as your unique shrine chest? Having to collect 40 koroks before getting another upgrade? Shrines as a whole? doing something amazing and then finding out your reward is a shrine is one of the biggest let downs the game can give you. When he said ""people who are extrinsically motivated will stop doing enemy camps the second their weapons are stronger than the average drop of the enemies in the camp"" thats... I've been saying that since literal day one of the game's release.*

*I think my biggest problem with Breath of the Wild is that the Zelda series prior to it's release has perhaps the greatest extrinsic game design in the world. When BotW went back to the intrisic values that Zelda 1 embodied, and in fact ""went so far as to punish extrinsically motivated players"" as Matthew Matosis put it, It really hit hard. He put into words why I hate the game so much.*

---

I'd like to talk about my own experiences with the Zelda series and some other games that excel at extrinsic rewards. I have enjoyed nine different previous Zelda titles to varying degrees. My favorites (aside from BotW) are Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, and Link's Awakening - all three hold a special place in my heart. I also distinctly remember being thoroughly engrossed by both Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess when I first played them. I can honestly say that I greatly enjoyed the classic Zelda formula. I have also greatly enjoyed all of the Metroid games that I've played, with Metroid Fusion, Metroid Prime 2, and Metroid: Zero Mission being stand-outs for me. Two games that I've first experienced within the last 12 months - Hollow Knight and Subnautica, both of which contain lots of great extrinsic rewards - are some of my favorite gaming experiences of all time. I should also note the first two Paper Mario games as a couple of others that I love a great deal. 


I just wanted to make it clear that I greatly enjoy many games that are clearly designed heavily around extrinsic rewards. And yet, Breath of the Wild is possibly my favorite game of all time. I've poured far more hours into BotW than the vast majority of the other games that I've played (possibly all of them). BotW utterly dominated my life outside of work for months, and I've started I think six different playthroughs of it (and I still have an itch to get back into it). And I know that the intrinsic rewards of BotW are why I loved the game so much. I never really thought about the lack of unique extrinsic rewards because the moment-to-moment gameplay was so engaging for me. I honestly feel quite sad for people who weren't able to enjoy BotW, because I think all gamers should be able to experience the type of joy that I did playing BotW. 


What I've thought about a lot while looking at criticisms of the game from people who don't like it is: Would have it been possible for them to enjoy the game to a much greater degree if they had adjusted their mindset while playing it? If they had not fixated so much on the lack of extrinsic rewards and just accepted the game for what it was, if they had gone in with a more open mind, could they potentially have experienced the same type of joy that I did?


I truly hope that more players can enjoy the next 3D Zelda game more than they did BotW. I would be happy if Nintendo could cater more to extrinsic reward-minded players in the next game, but I don't want them to lose sight of the immense value in solid gameplay that is intrinsically rewarding. I hope that more players can come to genuinely appreciate the intrinsic rewards and this new approach to Zelda game design. ",29,public,,0
truezelda,t3_avyp9w,Exploring Hyrule in Wind Waker,"I'm sure I'm not the first one to bring this up, but I was pretty disappointed that we barely got to see Hyrule in The Wind Waker. Maybe it was just because of time constraints, but I think Nintendo could've much more with Wind Waker since it is a relatively short game. A sort of Dark World mechanic could've been used in Hyrule, where once you get down there and think the quest is over there's just more to do once you're there.

For example, say you obtain the Master Sword and go through the Forsaken Fortress as normal. When it comes time to restore the sword, why have islands be the entrance to the dungeons? I don't see why Hyrule Castle had to be sealed off from the rest of the kingdom, so why not have the player explore a bit of Hyrule to find the Earth and Wind temples (the entrances being holes on islands that you fall into doesn't make much sense anyway)? 

This could also make the Triforce hunt a bit more bearable. Maybe instead of the Triforce being sunken treasure, there's a couple new dungeons containing Triforce pieces, maybe not all 8, but a few. 

I love the Wind Waker and the way the game turned out, but I just feel like there was some wasted opportunity by having the player go to Hyrule and not do anything there but find the Master Sword and fight Ganonforf.

Edit: I've been in a Zelda craze this week and I watched a video of cut content from games. Turns out Hyrule proper was at one point planned in Wind Waker. Fun stuff. There was even a quick travel method planned for getting back to the surface!",23,public,,0

I've already learned a lot by flying around and taking a close look at the details in these games without having to load up the games themselves, so it's really convenient.

truezelda,t3_avuv6e,"If Breath of the Wild had a more traditional 'dungeon item' system, what would the rewards be?","And I am writing this assuming you either get the item instead of the Champion ability or instead of the Champion's signature weapon. With my own examples I tried to stay away from making the rewards just some fancy armour or weapon and make the reward something more of a permanent upgrade separate from the equipment system. Here are the examples I came up with:

* Beating Vah Rudania could have given you something like **Climbing Gauntlets** which would either make climbing/leaping take less stamina, give you a better grip when it's raining/allow you to climb icy cliffs in Hebra, make you climb faster or even a combination of all of the above.

* Beating Vah Medoh could have provided you with the **Glider** that you would originally obtain after clearing the Great Plateau (which in this scenario would either provide you with the sail cloth or a glider that's slower and/or require more stamina to use). Not only would this make more sense (the Glider has a Rito symbol on it so I always found it odd that the King gave it to you) but it would also fix the issue some people have with the game of the Glider being too good (with this solution at least requiring the player to interact with the world more instead of flying over it).

* Beating Vah Naboris could provide you with some sort of **Sled** (not exactly sure what form it would take) that you could use for Shield Surfing/Snow Boarding/Sand Seal Racing without any of those absolutely ruining the durability of your shield. This would also encourage the player to use the shield surfing more (which would be especially prudent if you hadn't gotten the Vah Medoh reward I listed above yet). 

* Beating Vah Ruta could grant the player something like the **Water Dragon's Scale** from Skyward Sword (fashioned into earrings) that would either allow Link to swim for a longer period of time or even allow him to dive under the water. (To be perfectly honest this is the only one I couldn't think of a good reward as well as with the others)

Though I imagined this post to be more for rewards for beating the Divine Beasts, if you have ideas for similar items that would be rewards for sidequests or even just exploring the world I'd love to hear those as well.",23,public,,0

truezelda,t3_av88ts,Why I personally loved the Temple of the Ocean King,"Ok, so the consensus here (and everywhere for that matter) seems to be that Temple of the Ocean King is the worst dungeon of all time. I actually love it, and while I get why some might not like it, I think it doesn't get as much credit as its worth. 

First of all, people say that every visit is the same and that you do the same things over and over again. This is not true. The dungeon is filled with secret rooms, treasures, and shortcuts that can only be accessed with items that you don't currently have during the visit that you first reach those locations. This concept appears many times within the Zelda series, but never within a dungeon and I think it works well. The dungeon kind of taunts you with things that you can't yet access, making you anticipate your next visit with new gear that will help you get new stuff. 

Secondly, people often complain about the Phantoms because you can't kill them. I personally like the Phantoms because for once you actually need to be vigilant and watch your surroundings. It's also a refreshing break from all the complete suck-up enemies that are extremely easy to kill (this isn't Phantom Hourglass, this is every Zelda game. 90% of enemies won't even damage you and are trivial kills.) 

Lastly, the time limit was a really great concept to me. It's a challenge that we hardly see in dungeons and something new is nice sometimes. I always see people complaining about how stressful it is, but that is obviously the point. There is plenty of time to figure out puzzles in your head in the safe zones. 


All in all, don't understand the hate on this dungeon. Even if you don't like doing it all over again every time, they even put a halfway point teleporter, but if there is something that I'm missing that makes this dungeon terrible somehow, please let me know because I enjoyed every bit of the Temple of the Ocean King. Sometimes different isn't always bad.",88,public,,0

* Zelda 1: Ganon is front and center.
* Zelda II: Ganon being revived is the Game Over scenario.
* A Link to the Past: Agahnim was Ganon's (in Japanese) bunshin, or a fragment of Ganon, that could escape to the Light World.
* Link's Awakening: Nightmare only took the form of Ganon and Agahnim
* Ocarina of Time: Ganondorf is front and center.
* Oracle of Seasons/Ages: Ganon is dead; Twinrova is behind the plot.
* The Wind Waker: Ganondorf is front and center.
* Four Swords Adventures: **Played Straight**
* Twilight Princess: **Played Straight**
* Phantom Houglass: Ganondorf only has a cameo in the intro narration.
* A Link Between Worlds: Ganon is taken over by Yuga.
* Breath of the Wild: Calamity Ganon is front and center.

It made me realise that these bad theories blend together after a while.

Here's some clich√©s I can think of:

- The Fierce Deity is Majora's rival. (This comes from the manga, where Skull Kid gives Link the Fierce Deity Mask before the final battle, or something.)
- The Fierce Deity is evil.
- Not knowing what a fierce deity is.
- ""Majora"" is the name of a demon sealed in the mask. (Fun fact: this isn't game canon.)
- Trying to connect Majora's Mask (the game) to another game. Common ideas include the Dark Interlopers creating Majora's Mask, and the setting of a recent-ish handheld game of their choosing is actually Termina.
- Tetraforce.
- Everything represented by eye symbols is connected.

truezelda,t3_avk4pw,The Zelda Timeline is broken,"You should know that us Zelda fans love to speculate about timeline shit, For me it's truly just the intrigue and curiosity I experience when I talk about this stuff. I love the Zelda timeline but I also hate it, it's intriguing but also way to broken to be called a timeline, I mean the dictionary definition of the word timeline is "" a graphic representation of the passage of time as a line."" and sure the Zelda ""Timeline"" is a graphic representation of the passage of time in the Zelda series but it is in no way a timeline. Looking back there was never supposed to be a Zelda ""Timeline"", the first Zelda was originally supposed to be the first in the timeline but that never came to be. Sure there are games that were baked into the timeline but the problem is they're mostly newer games (SS,WW,) all the older games are thrown into the downfall timeline(a garbage chute of sorts for games that just don't fit), some of them make sense like A Link to the Past having the seven wise-men capturing the essence of the seven Sages from Ocarina of Time but even at that there are several inconsistencies in the way things fit together (Like a puzzle that has pieces that fit together but don't look just right) and don't even get me started with that stupid timeline split. Time travel itself is messy but trying to make a timeline with time travel implemented into it is a nightmare, true the Zelda timeline isn't as complicated as it could be but it's still there in terms of Time travel Timelines. The Zelda ""timeline"" is only there as an afterthought which is why it's so messy, fan's insisted on a Zelda timeline once upon a time and the only way for it to make any sense was to create separate places for games that make sense in one timeline and the games that don't really fit in another (I know I'm treating the child and adult timeline as the same thing but you get my point.)

truezelda,t3_auhaty,Connection between Arbiter's Ground (TP) and the Forest Temple (OoT),"Are the 4 Poes in the Arbiter's Grounds the same spirits as the Poe Sisters from the Forest Temple in OoT? They have the exact same role in both dungeons, where they had to be tracked down and defeated, allowing the flame from their poe lantern to light a torches to a big room with spinning walls. I'm fairly certain the ""fourth"" poe of each had the same attack pattern, splitting into 4 and Link needing to attack the real one.

Instead of the Poe Sisters moving to the Arbiters Grounds as Poes, what if they weren't Poes in the Forest Temple in the Child Timeline? What if they died and became Poes in the 7 years it took for Link to become an adult (like Dampe)?

For the Poe Sisters to be seemingly working for Ganondorf in the Forest Temple and in the Arbiter's Grounds, I am going to assume they were high ranking/skilled Gerudo thieves for Ganondorf. That's probably how they got rich enough to get a whole mansion in the Woods! But, they must have died with regret, unfinished business, or hate, because they are Poes, after all. 

I believe Ganondorf killed the Poe Sisters when Link accidentally let Ganondorf get the Triforce. Nabooru had already been secretly against Ganondorf by the time this happened, so if some of his other followers wanted to rebel, it would also make sense. Because they were so close to Ganondorf, I believe they tried to betray him earlier, because he was more than powerful with the Triforce, but they were caught and killed. As a punishment and a convenient tool, they were to serve him in their death as Poes who would act as the key to the boss room of the Forest Temple, in their own mansion. 

The Poe sisters act as keys to another door, the door leading to the rest of Arbiter's Grounds. The room they guard is another room with rotating walls, sharing similar architecture to that of the Forest Temple. In the Child Timeline, Ganondorf is exposed, but he fights back before they execute him. There are still some Gerudo who conspired against him, and when they were caught, they were killed. This time, when the Poe Sisters were killed, they were cursed to keep people out of the Arbiter's Grounds, his hideout. The Hylians were able to get through and catch Ganondorf, and he was executed at the Mirror Chamber. The Arbiter's Grounds was turned into a prison and the remaining Gerudos were arrested or killed. Because the Hylians didn't want anyone else to get to the Mirror Chamber, they most likely redid the curse on the Poe Sisters, as their [Wingcrest](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda11/Walkthrough/HD13/009.jpg) is above the door and on the torches. 

TL;DR: The Poe sisters were Top Tier goons for Ganon, but they were conspirators. When they got caught, Ganon cursed them to guard his temples. In the Adult Timeline, it would be the Forest Temple. In the Child Timeline, it would be the Arbiter's Grounds (which was later resealed by the Hylians judging by the Wingcrest symbols). ",45,public,,0

The Lanayru Desert. Arguably the most interesting of the three areas on the Surface. There are far more remnants of the ancient civilization that lived here, than in the Faron Woods, or the Eldin Volcano. Added to this is the fact that we can gain even more information through the Timeshift Stones. All this information makes it both easier, and harder, to piece together its history as a region, and its connections to the rest of the Surface world.

**Building a better Mining Tool**

To crack this puzzle, let's start with one of the most unique races in the Zelda universe, [the Ancient Robots](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/0/0e/Ancient_Robot.png).

The lifeless bodies of the Ancient Robots can be found all over the Lanayru Desert. From a casual observation of the region, it's easy to conclude that the Ancient Robots were the civilization that lived there. There are many structures built for their use, and many monuments to their culture. These [massive statues in their image](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/7837999_orig.jpg) emphasize the importance of this race to the region. 

But, where did the Ancient Robots come from? Were they created by the Golden Goddesses, like all other life in the world?

&gt;**LD-301**

&gt;This robot is part of the LD-301 Series of **artificial life-forms**. As just one of a number of **mass produced robots**, it was not assigned a name. These **robots usually work to mine Timeshift Stones and provide maintenance**.

&gt;**LD-301N Skipper**

&gt;This unit's designation is LD-301N Skipper. It is the **leadership model of this series of artificial life-forms**. The **original purpose of this series of robots was mining**. It is the **supreme model of the mass-produced robots**.

&gt;- Fi 

According to Fi, the Ancient Robots are a form of artificial life. There are different models, some mass produced for the purpose of mining and maintenance. Other models include [LD-002S](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/4/48/Scervo.png) and [LD-003D](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/8/8f/LD-003K_Dreadfuse.png).

So, who created these artificial life-forms?

The game never explicitly says. However, there is a clear relationship between the Ancient Robots and Lanayru, the Thunder Dragon:

&gt;We got permission from **our master, the Thunder Dragon**, to dig for Timeshift Stones, vweep.

&gt;There are lots of big Timeshift Stones here, zrrt. **Did you get permission from Master Thunder Dragon to come here like we did**, vrrm? We were just about to transport this Timeshift Stone to Master Thunder Dragon, vweep.

&gt;- Ancient Robots 

&gt;And my gut tells me that one of the three dragons of legend, **the Thunder Dragon, lives there! These robots are connected to him somehow. I am sure of it**, bud.

&gt;- Golo, the Goron

All of this looks like it points to the Thunder Dragon as the creator of the Ancient Robots, but is he really?

According to Fi, the Thunder Dragon is ""**the great protector of the Lanayru Province**"". It would make sense that a race of artificial servants would call him Master. The mining of the Timeshift Stones is done under his supervision, as the protector of the region. But, that isn't proof that he created them.

What about the fact that he is the Thunder Dragon, with power over lightning? Doesn't that mean he created the robots, and powered them with electricity? Well, no. While the Ancient Robots run on electricity, they are powered by the Timeshift Stones:

&gt;**The Timeshift Stones power us, as well as the machines we use**, vreep! That's why we have to stay hard at work, zoop!

&gt;- Ancient Robot

That means someone had to mine the Stones before the Ancient Robots were created. We actually know where the mining of Timeshift Stones started in the Lanayru Province:

&gt;**Lanayru Gorge**

&gt;This is Lanayru Gorge. **Of all the Timeshift Stone mining areas here, this was the very first to be mined**.

Lanayru Gorge (Valley in the Japanese version) is the home of the Thunder Dragon. It's the start of everything that happened in the region.

Did the Thunder Dragon mine the first Timeshift Stones from his home and create the Ancient Robots?

I don't think so, at least not by himself. It just doesn't seem right that a god of lightning, and the great protector of the region, would start mining Timeshift Stones by himself.

I think it's likely Hylia asked him to start, and oversee the operation, and I believe she guided the ancient humans to help him.

**A Brief History of Time**

Before focusing on Hylia, let's see if there's any evidence of the ancient humans being involved in the region. To do this we need to first establlish exactly when in the past the Timeshift Stones allow us to see.

&gt;**I don't see many humans around here**, vrrt. Are you interested in the Timeshift Stones, phweep?

&gt;- Ancient Robot

&gt;Oh, hello... **I haven't had a visitor like you here in...quite a while. You're a human, aren't you**? You must have some reason for coming this far. What is it?

&gt;- Lanayru, Thunder Dragon

Activating the Timeshift Stones allows Link to see back into the Era of the Goddess Hylia. The presence of Technoblins, in these time windows on the past, points to a time near the end of the era. Demons appeared in this first age, after creation, when Demise and his army erupted through the earth. However, we don't see either the Ancient Robots or Lanayru particularly worried about, or even mention, the great war with Demise. [One of the robots says that the attacks have started ""recently""](http://i.imgur.com/tG8Mq.png). On the other hand, Lanayru says to Link:

&gt;Hold on, now. **Didn't you just say you came from the sky, Link? So then you're the hero chosen by the goddess, aren't you?**

Remember that we are talking to Lanayru through a window into the past. From his point of view, he knows all about Hylia's chosen hero from the sky. The Hero with whom he must share his part of the Song of the Hero, which will lead to the Triforce. This must mean that the Timeshift Stones open a portal to a time when Hylia has started to prepare for the destruction of Demise. 

There is further evidence for this when we consider the Time Gates. Both the Time Gate in Lanayru, and the one in the Temple of Hylia were created using the Timeshift Stones. There is a direct connection between the Lanayru Mining Facility and the Temple of Time. Zelda and Impa travel to the past through the Gate in Lanayru. Later, Link meets up with them by traveling through the Gate in the Sealed Temple. Both Time Gates lead to the same time period. When is that?

&gt;You stand in the past, ages before your own time. **Here the goddess, Hylia, has only just sealed away Demise... And little time has passed since the goddess sent the outcropping of rock into the sky that would one day become Skyloft**.

&gt;- Impa

So, Demise has just been sealed, and ""little time has passed"" since the humans were sent to the Sky. It's reasonable to believe that the Timeshift Stones open windows to roughly the same time period in the past. I say roughly because neither the Ancient Robots or Lanayru are completely surprised to see a human, which they might be if they knew they had all been sent into the sky. Also, as mentioned earlier, one of the robots said that the attacks by the Bokoblins had only started recently. Either way, the time period we see in the past, through the Timeshift Stones, must be towards the end of the Era of the Goddess Hylia. 

At this point in time, the presence of humans in the Lanayru Province is rare. However, I don't believe that was always the case. Both the Ancient Robots and Lanayru recognize humans, so there must have been some contact in their past. 

**East meets West**

Here's some evidence for the involvement of the ancient humans in the Lanayru Province.

**A**. [The crest dominating the sky above the Temple of Time](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/9905490_orig.png). The symbol of the Bird, what will later became known as the Hylian Crest, with the Triforce above it. A modified version of these two symbols, will become the Wingcrest, the symbol of the future Royal Family of Hyrule. We know this symbol is connected to the humans because it is [worn prominently by Gaepora](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/thumb/5/55/Gaepora.png/205px-Gaepora.png?version=e9396cf5d2d10a4a6daea60693da8459), the leader of their descendants on Skyloft. The symbol also appears on the Hylian Shield, which Lanayru holds. I'll discuss this later on.

**B**. In front of the Temple of Time is a [massive tree](https://imgur.com/gallery/kXe0RpJ). It can be brought back to life by activating a Timeshift Stone. Passing through the tree is necessary to reach the front entrance to the Temple. The Forest was the original home of the humans, and still important to them. Taking a symbol of their place of origin and bringing it to this important place creates a connection between them. A tree in the Lanayru Province is significant because we're repeatedly told by the Ancient Robots that no trees grow there.

&gt;Master Thunder Dragon's condition has been bad for a long time, and **the soil here is not suitable for growing trees**, zrrt.

&gt;Make sure you plant the seedling somewhere it will be sure to thrive, phoo-weep. **I fear growing the seedling to maturity in Lanayru Province is impossible**,brrzrrt.

&gt;**This area is only good for growing grass and flowers**, zrrt.

&gt;**The Lanayru area is terrible for growing trees**, zrrt.

&gt;- Ancient Robots

**C**. The connection between the Faron Woods and Lanayru Province is also shown through the Beetle. A product of Lanayru technology, it was placed inside the Skyview Temple. (Interestingly, Crystal Switches, an advanced form of technology, are only found on the Surface in the Faron and Lanayru regions.) This must have happened early on in the rise on Lanayru technology, since the Robot who upgrades the Beetle calls it an older model.

&gt;Oh... Look at that, zrrpt... **You have a Beetle. It appears to be an older model of Lanayru fabrication**.

&gt;- Ancient Robot

**D**. The repairman Gondo in Skyloft has an Ancient Robot he inherited from his grandfather. The robot's name is Scrapper, and he needs the extract from an Ancient Flower, found in the Lanayru region's past, to make him functional again. The robot was working when his grandfather owned him, and he would use him to collect things from the Surface. All the other Skyloftians think Gondo and his grandfather are crazy. Realistically, Gondo's family must have had Scrapper in their possession since before the island was raised into the Sky by Hylia. While the people of Skyloft forgot about life on the Surface over time, Scrapper is proof that the ancient humans and robots interacted. Perhaps it's proof of some of those humans having robot servants.

About the Lanayru Gorge, the home of the Thunder Dragon, the starting point for the entire mining operation, we're told:

&gt;Signs indicate that **an ancient civilization established a quarry here to mine the deposit of high-quality Timeshift Stones**.

More than just the Thunder Dragon, that ancient civilization was the ancient humans. As the previous post highlighted, the humans learned to mine in the Eldin Region. They took these skills with them as they continued to explore into the Lanayru region. However, while they may have helped to start the mining operation in the Lanayru Province, the evidence shows that they did not stay.

**Rise of the Machines**

As was quoted earlier, both the Ancient Robots and Lanayru say that it's been a long time since they've seen a human. Apart from the fact that they are living near the end of the Era of the Goddess Hylia, there is another very good reason for this:

&gt;Where did you come from, dzzzzt? We're here collecting Timeshift Stones and transporting them to Lanayru Mining Facility. **Stay away from the blue stones, zrrpt. They're too dangerous for humans!**

&gt;- Ancient Robot

Everything about the Lanayru Province revolves around the mining, processing, and shipping of Timeshift Stones. With the Ancient Robots handling every step, you could call it a completely automated process.

While the ancient humans must have started the mining of Timeshift Stones before the Ancient Robots were created, why did it become too dangerous for them? Because of [the side effects](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/abcjjs/before_the_dawn_of_time/). Striking a Timeshift (Spacetime in the Japanese version) Stone opens a window into the past. The past for those living in the Era of the Goddess, the very first era after Creation, is Chaos. (Please read the linked post for more information.) Regardless, the Stones were too dangerous for humans. This explains why artificial life-forms were created in the first place, to do the work too dangerous for the humans or other races.

The Ancient Robots may have been mass produced, but over time they started to form their own culture. They even had families. 

&gt;That house holds many dear memories of my family, vrrm. I wonder when I will be able to go home, zrrt. I really want to see my family again, phweep...

&gt;- Skipper

&gt;Dear Dad, Good luck at work, vrrm!

&gt;- Skipper's child

They started to create monuments to their culture, as shown earlier, and in this [example](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/4872384_orig.png) as well. Commerce seems to have become important to them too. [Crates with a rupee symbol](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14/Walkthrough/07/0709.jpg) are common throughout the region. Their economy was based on the Timeshift Stones, and the technology based on them. Their trade reached not just the other two provinces, but potentially the whole world:

&gt;This is Lanayru Sand Sea. This whole area was once a vast ocean. But the water has all evaporated, and now the area is a sea of sand. **Signs indicate that this place functioned as a port**, linking the land to the sea.

As their culture thrived, they evolved from mass produced servants into a proud race. Many of the Ancient Robots, not just Scrapper, can be quite dismissive towards Link. There is no subservient attitude shown towards humans in general, despite the likely possibility that humans helped to create them. This may be because so much time has passed since then. The humans left a long time ago, and the robots have continued to evolve. By contrast, they are very respectful towards Lanayru, the Thunder Dragon, who remained the protector of the region. 

Their growth as a species also led to some criminal behaviour. Scervo is the leader of a gang of pirates. Interestingly, this is the only case of criminal activity, that I can think of, mentioned in the world of the Surface. That doesn't mean other races had no crime. Lanayru has far more information about its past. But again, it shows how far these machines came from their original purpose as miners.

The need for security is illustrated by one of the most important structures in robot society - the Lanayru Mining Facility. The facility is heavily guarded with many sophisticated forms of security. [Armos](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/1/18/SS_Armos.png), [Beamos](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/b/b4/Beamos_SS.png), and [Sentrobes](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/0/09/SentrobeSS.png) provide protection for the facility and its precious materials. This level of security goes beyond the need to protect humans, and others, from accidentally activating a Timeshift Stone. One likely reason is theft, as illustrated by the pirates. Another possible reason is scarier. Staldra are undead demons from before the dawn of time. For how that's possible, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/abcjjs/before_the_dawn_of_time/). They are only found in the Lanayru Mining Facility, and the Skyview Temple. Two areas linked by Timeshift Stone powered technology. Clearly, there is some danger involved in processing the Stones. 

**Human Evolution under a Watchful Eye**

To summarise so far, the ancient humans first arrived at the Lanayru region near the Gorge. This was where the Thunder Dragon lived. They mined the first Timeshift Stones in that area. By studying the Stones, and working with the Dragon, they developed new forms of technology. To continue mining the Stones, the Ancient Robots were created to take over the operation. The humans left the region for safety, and allowed this automated process to continue under the supervision of Lanayru. Over time, the Ancient Robots developed into a society, and continued to evolve. However, the humans kept in contact with the region, maintaining a strong relationship between the two cultures. The massive crest over the Temple of Time shows that while the Ancient Robots were autonomous, the region was still a human province - the Lanayru Province. It was still under their oversight. And the humans were under the oversight, and direction, of someone else.

Hylia.

Why did the humans go to the Lanayru region in the first place? Why did they start to mine the Timeshift Stones? Why did they automate the process by creating a new form of artificial life? What was the point?

The humans themselves were evolving. They had already changed so much. From children of the forest, living in harmony with their surroundings, to explorers learning to harness the power of the earth and fire. Their gaze had been turned towards the heavens by the Goddess. Their wisdom and power, as a race, growing with each step. And this was the next step. The incredible technology, and knowledge, derived from the Timeshift Stones dramatically increased the wisdom and power of the humans. They could almost touch the sky. 

But, make no mistake, Hylia was the hand guiding all of this. Whose symbol is engraved on every Timeshift Stone that has been processed? Not the symbols, we'll discuss later, related to the Lanayru Province and the Ancient Robots. Not the symbols connected to the ancient humans, either Leaf or Bird. It's a symbol we saw the [beginnings of back in the Skyview Temple](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/3769929.png?1502656151). The form of this symbol were most familiar with [decorates Impa's skin and clothes](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/thumb/8/8d/SS_Impa_Artwork.png/1025px-SS_Impa_Artwork.png). But, [engraved on the Timeshift Stones, it takes this form](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/8617434.png?308). 

Just as the Bird symbol of the humans has many forms in the ancient world of the Surface, apart from the well known Hylian Crest. So too, the Sheikah Eye symbol existed in a number of forms during that era as well. Impa tells us that the Sheikah are ""the goddess's chosen guardians"". The mining of the Lanayru Province was ultimately Hylia's operation, and it was closely monitored under her watchful Eye. As the chief goddess of the world, all uses of these dangerous Timeshift Stones were personally sanctioned and approved by her.

The ultimate use of the Timeshift Stones was to create the two Gates of Time. These Gates were essential to Hylia's plans. Did Hylia already have an inkling that she would need them when she directed the ancient humans towards the Lanayru region, or did a glimpse of the [Overwhelming Existence](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/abcjjs/before_the_dawn_of_time/) through the Timeshift Stones prompt her to start preparing? It's hard to say for certain. It may have initially been just for knowledge. 
 
Whatever the case, the knowledge and power gained from the Lanayru region by the ancient humans was not the end of their journey. They could almost, but not quite, touch the sky. To finally do so required more than technological growth. It required *spiritual* growth. 

Next time, the ancient humans go full circle, back to their beginning, in order to reach nirvana.

**Lightning Round**

*Why did the Lanayru Province transform into a desert?*

Fi says a couple of things on this subject:

&gt;This arid region was transformed into a desert over the course of several hundred years.

&gt;The terrain in this area changed dramatically as climate forces rapidly turned it into a desert.

Were these changes natural or man/robot made?

The game doesn't say. However, when the game was first released in 2011, the [official website had this to say](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/skyward_sword_new_area_details_via_official_site/):

&gt;The Lanayru region was once a lush, green landscape, but **due to the irresponsible actions of its past inhabitants, the natural resources of the area have been stripped dry**. Now all that remains are sands as far as the eye can see, dangerous patches of quicksand, and other hazards.

Now, some may question whether the information from a website is canon, but I think it's reasonable. Ask yourself, was the civilization of the Lanayru Region sustainable? Remember, this is what the Ancient Robots tell us:

&gt;**The Timeshift Stones power us, as well as the machines we use**, vreep! **That's why we have to stay hard at work**, zoop!

They need to keep on mining the Stones to power themselves and their technology. I very much doubt that the Timeshift Stones are an infinite resource, and I doubt that continuous mining was great for their environment. Maybe if Hylia had stuck around she could have helped them find an alternate solution. It's clear that Lanayru, the Thunder Dragon, was not able to help them. Even after Link cures him of his illness in the past, the desert doesn't disappear. Perhaps the damage had already been done. Ultimately, the civilization of the Ancient Robots destroyed themselves. That's kind of sobering for a Zelda game.

*What other symbols were used in the Lanayru Province?*

There are two other prominent symbols found in the region. The first one can be seen [here on top of the robot's head](http://i.imgur.com/aZr1B.png), [here on top of the Armos' head](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/1/18/SS_Armos.png), and [here on the railing of the Sandship](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DoorSymbolAgain.png). This stylized tick-shaped symbol seems to be directly connected to the Ancient Robots. 

The second symbol can be seen [here on top of Skipper's hat](http://i.imgur.com/irNJv.png), [here underneath the head of the Beamos](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/b/b4/Beamos_SS.png), and [here on the side of the Lanayru Mining Facility](http://i.imgur.com/SBBSR.png). This symbol also seems to be connected to the Ancient Robots. However, the symbol has a certain plant-like quality to it, as when fully displayed [here](http://i.imgur.com/kFiF5.png). Plants make us think of the forest and the symbols used by the humans. Perhaps this particular symbol reflects the connection between the humans and the robots.

These two symbols are found throughout the Lanayru Province, but none of them is more prominently displayed than the Bird Crest above the Temple of Time. The humans, and ultimately Hylia, are the ones in charge of the province. The fact that it's called the Lanayru Province proves that it's part of a larger nation or empire. The Ancient Robots, themselves, refer to their region as a province:

&gt;I fear growing the seedling to maturity in **Lanayru Province** is impossible,brrzrrt.

So, they acknowledge that their culture is part of a greater entity.

*How could Lanayru, the Thunder Dragon, have a Hylian Shield?*

Eldin, the Fire Dragon, tells us about Lanayru:

&gt;This dragon possesses **a legendary shield**. It is truly one of its most prized treasures.

&gt;It is said that the Thunder Dragon delights in testing those with promise in the hopes of someday **finding a worthy recipient for the shield**.

When you receive the shield, the game says this:

&gt;You got the Hylian Shield! This **legendary shield is imbued with heroic power, making it completely indestructible**!

This isn't a mass produced shield. It's a legendary shield, ""imbued with heroic power"", that will only be passed on to someone who proves themselves worthy. Someone like the Hero chosen by the goddess? 

The shield is decorated with the same symbols as those above the Temple of Time. The Triforce, and the Hylian Crest. We know the humans weren't called Hylians during the Era of the Goddess, and we know from Demise that there were no human warriors, or Hero, during the war. So, how can there be a Hylian Shield?

First of all, even though the humans weren't called Hylians back then, the symbol still existed as has been already pointed out. So then, it must be called the *Hylian* Shield for a different reason. The most obvious reason is that it's named after Hylia herself, just as the humans will be later on. The shield is imbued with a power that makes it indestructible, and is placed in the care of one of the Dragons. That sounds exactly like something Hylia would do. Even the test of worthiness, before it can be received, fits with Hylia's M.O.

So, just like the legendary Goddess Sword, the legendary Hylian Shield is a gift from Hylia to her chosen hero. She knew this Hero would be a human, and so the shield is fittingly decorated with the Triforce and the Bird Crest. 

*What was the real world inspiration for the Ancient Robots?*

The Ancient Robots are based on [Dog≈´](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog≈´) - small figurines made during the [Jomon period](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/J≈çmon_period) of prehistoric Japan. Some examples can be seen [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/2956061.jpg?384) and [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/473877_orig.jpg). The developers have used the Jomon period a number of times as the inspiration for the design of ancient, but advanced, civilizations. Interestingly, one theory about Dog≈´ says they represented mother goddesses. 

And with that, this post is **finally** over. If you made it to the end congratulations. The next post should be the same length as the previous ones.

truezelda,t3_au3thx,"If Zelda needs another ""world filler"", how about revisiting the Spirit Gems from Phantom Hourglass?","As I'm sure we all agree, the Zelda series is in need of more good ideas for ""world fillers"". The stock Zelda world filler have been the Rupees, Heart Pieces, and Materials, but we need something more than that.

I've already talked about the [Rings](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/amxfg7/the_oracle_series_rings_are_the_best_world_filler/) being a great world filler, since they (mostly) changed Link's capabilities in simple, yet interesting and unique ways. But if we take a step below, we can see that they tried something simpler in a subsequent game: the [Spirit Gems](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Spirit_Gems) from Phantom Hourglass.

For those of you who didn't play Phantom Hourglass, the Spirit Gems are an interesting collectible. There are three special fairies who can enhance your capabilities: the Spirit of Power enhances your sword power, the Spirit of Wisdom enhances your Defense, and the Spirit of Courage gives you sword beams. You can equip one of these fairies to give you their enhancement, but to access these enhancements, you need to find 10 Spirit gems corresponding to their piece of of the Triforce. There are 20 each, meaning 60 in total. Just finding 10 of one type gives you the enhancement, but finding all 20 of a type gives you the ""perfect"" enhancement: quad sword damage, quad defense, or wide sword beams.

It's so simple in concept, yet such a great idea for the series. I don't understand why they threw away that idea in favor of leaning on Rupees, Heart Pieces, and Materials again. Increasing your stats through exploration is a perfect way of filling the world and rewarding the player without leaning too much into RPG elements. This certainly would have been great for BotW, especially given that Link's base strength and defense are both zero, which is rather unfair considering the enemies do have base strength.

I personally wouldn't want to be forced to swap between enhanced defense or strength again; just having the Spirit gems permanently increase your base strength when you find a number of them would be enough (like say 4 power gems increases your base strength by 1, 4 courage gems slows your stamina drain by a bit).

It's just an idea that I'd like to see come back, along with the Rings. It would go so well with the ""multiple weapons"" thing, too; hopefully they won't throw away the multiple weapons idea like they did the Rings or the Spirit Gems.",114,public,,0

I don't really want some other lame ass villain (pure speculation, but still. Any other villain will probably be some characterless, robed and hooded wizard like in all the other Zelda games Ganon isn't in). Anyways, I wanna know what you guys think they'll do.

truezelda,t3_atm8xu,"The adventure of your dreams: could Link's Awakening include ""Zelda Maker""?","Link's Awakening will be released in 2019 as a modern remake of the classic, but I wonder if it'll have another twist: ""Legend of Zelda Maker"". Imagine if you could create and share custom quests, similar to Super Mario Maker.

""That won't happen!"" you say. I agree that it's unlikely, but here are some reasons why it could:

1. It might make business sense for Nintendo.

   Mario Maker [has sold 4 million copies as of this writing](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/wiiu.html) and [a sequel is forthcoming](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223976/super-mario-maker-2-nintendo-switch-release-date-june-2019), so they clearly feel the concept was worth it.
   
   But how many units would a Zelda maker sell? It's impossible to say, and I doubt my forecasting is as high-quality as a proper analyst's, but let's do some back-of-the-napkin math:
   
   * The Super Mario franchise has sold [330.58 million games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises#cite_ref-SuperMario_1-1); the Zelda franchise has sold [91.01 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises#cite_ref-Zelda_61-0). By these numbers, a Zelda game would sell 28% of what a Mario game would. If Mario Maker sold 4 million units, Zelda Maker would sell about 1.1 million copies.
   * ""A Zelda game would sell 28% of what a Mario game would"" isn't quite right. [Breath of the Wild's sales were _85%_ of Super Mario Odyssey's](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html), and by those numbers, a Mario Maker equivalent would sell 3.4 million.
   * Mario Maker was released on the Wii U. The Switch has sold [more than twice as well as the Wii U](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html). Nintendo hopes that Mario Maker 2 will sell better than the original, a hope that one could extrapolate to a Zelda game, too.
   * Tri Force Heroes is the worst-selling Zelda game in ten years at [1.14 million copies](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tri_Force_Heroes#Sales). We can assume a new Zelda game will sell at least this well.

   These three numbers vary pretty wildly, but even a conservative estimate puts a new Zelda at at least a million sales. And that's just for a Zelda maker‚Äîwe already know we're getting a full remake of Link's Awakening.
   
   Depending on the game's budget (which I expect to be lower than a new release), Nintendo may decide such a bet is worth it.

2. Game developers sometimes polish and release their internal tools to the end consumer. For example, [Wargroove](https://wargroove.com/) included their whole campaign editor as a core feature.

   This happened with Breath of the Wild's Hero's Path. The development team tracked its testers' movements as they played to design a better game, and they decided to release it as a ""real"" feature.
   
3. A game developer can more easily build a public-facing 2D level editor than a 3D one. While the remake is rendered in three dimensions, Link's Awakening is a 2D game, so it lends itself well to this kind of user-friendly editor.

   *Edit:* /u/SvenHudson pointed out that the benefit is the grid-based nature of the editor, not the dimensionality. For example, 3D Tony Hawk games had robust level editors. They accomplished this with a grid.

4. Some part of the Nintendo machine is aware of the [unofficial Zelda Maker](https://kotaku.com/1794176131) released in 2015. Nintendo is notorously litigious with unofficial content and this is no exception, but these ideas may have made their way to developers' eyes.

   Having worked at large companies, I think it's unlikely that Nintendo's American legal team communicates with Nintendo's Japanese development teams, but like [Apple gets inspired by iPhone jailbreakers](https://yalujailbreak.net/apple-steals-jailbreak-ios-11/), unofficial ideas can bubble up into official creations.

5. Nintendo usually adds new features in remakes. Link's Awakening DX added a whole new dungeon; the remake of the first Mario &amp; Luigi game [added a whole new campaign](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_%26_Luigi:_Superstar_Saga_%2B_Bowser%27s_Minions#Minion_Quest:_The_Search_for_Bowser); Wind Waker HD [had a number of additions](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker_HD#Changes_and_Additions).

   What new features, if any, will the Switch re-release have? A level editor is one possibility.

6. Dreams are a core motif in Link's Awakening. A tagline like ""build the adventure of your dreams"" is not a huge logical leap.

Even together, none of these points are enough to make an editor feel even remotely likely. There are also points against this theory‚Äîfor example, how would a player edit some of the more complex parts of the game, like triggers, boss battles, and cutscenes?

truezelda,t3_atcil5,What are your favorite non-dungeon main story sequences?,"Let's talk about the non-dungeon story events. This aspect of the series tends to be, at best, sidelined compared to discussions about exploration and dungeoneering or, at worst, considered to ruin games for taking time away from exploration and dungeoneering.

But I still think we need to go deep into this. We need story events like this in order to develop the world in a meaningful way and have important characters interact with one another. ""Environmental storytelling"" can only go so far, and despite being a popular buzzword with some people, it's a lot more limiting than people think.

So what are your favorite parts of the main story that aren't dungeons? Some I like are:

* The non-Twilight part of the Death Mountain arc in Twilight Princess. You get to tell the mayor the kids are alright, you joust with King Bulblin, and you fight a normally friendly race. It's honestly a highlight of non-dungeon storytelling done right.
* The Ikana arc in Majora's Mask, for being incredibly mysterious and creepy while having worldbuilding in that one arc that rivals whole games.
* Sneaking past the guards to meet Zelda in Ocarina of Time. It's fun and lighthearted, and the guards don't mean any harm, but there's still a sense of urgency in the whole matter and the end of this part sets up the meat of the game.

For the purpose of this discussion, we can include the Divine Beast lead-ups even though they are technically ""optional"", but let's refrain from discussing sidequests such as Tarrey Town and Anju and Kafei.",71,public,,0
truezelda,t3_atbloj,Dragon flight - Revali's Gale is a scam,"*To be fair*, we're not really shown any of Revali's endeavors into ""unlocking the power""' of Revali's Gale before Zelda approaches him during the Champion's Ballad. However, aggressive confidence, paired with his insecurity against Link's natural achievements, leads me to believe he generally lacks integrity and just wanted fame and glory among the Rito, for whatever reason.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rito** are known for their inability to achieve normal flight without assistance. And yes, *the* Rito - whether the group in the Adult timeline are a fundamentally different species or not, their similar traits (*and insert something about artstyle and artistic liberties here)* are enough to draw from for the purpose of this submission.

In *Breath of the Wild*, Rito lack the ability to fly - capable only of achieving a glide-like descent from higher elevations. This is why they chose to live over Lake Totori, as its numerous updrafts and perched surfaces lean perfectly into their avian nature. These features allow them to achieve pseudo-flight locally, or live a relatively ""Hylian-like"" life abroad.

In *The Wind Waker*, we're told young Rito are relatively incapable of flight until they come of age, at which point they can visit the guardian spirit Valoo to ""receive their wings."" The Rito in this scenario are said to be of Zora descent - transformed or evolved, unknown - which actually introduces a lot to think about the species as a whole:

* Did ""Rito"" exist prior to Ocarina of Time's split - if not, from what context (world, player-familiarity, developer) does the word ""Rito"" come from?
* If it was an evolution, not a transformation, do groups of Zora eventually evolve into Rito anyway - are parallel groups of ""devolved"" Zora a counter balance to this?
* Why Rito - it's likely Zora were changed so they could not discover Hyrule underwater, whether it's natural evolution or not, why bird-form Rito? Whose idea, and in what context are the species related?

In any case, the two: are intelligent, avian creatures with hair, red eyes, ""blush"", and capable of speech; cannot achieve elevated flight on their own; and use tribal aesthetics in relation to hierarchy, clothing, in additional to similar naming conventions.

They differ in their portrayal of ""sprouting wings"" from human arms, and having a mouth instead of a lower beak - something I'd contest would look rather terrifying if placed in the opposite game.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

**Wind**, as we see then, is an important aspect of Rito life to both groups, as it's provides means of gliding when horizontal, or elevated flight in the form of an updraft. And it's very important to both games - an integral mechanic with *The Wind Waker*, and a primary mean of transport in *Breath of the Wild*.

The Rito on Lake Totiri, as previously mentioned, chose their location for its strong updrafts and the elevational advantage provided when gliding is your primary form of transport. We're not exactly sure why the Rito of Dragon Roost chose their location, however.

First, as already mentioned, a lot of important details are missing on the history of the Rito. Same species - sub species? Actually related to Zora? Who, when, where, and why, in regards to Zora eventually being situated on Dragon Roost as Rito? However it turns out, there's one very integral detail that may provide insight into the *where* bit - Dragon Roost is situated right in front ""the Wind Shrine,"" a pair of monuments dedicated to the wind gods.

It's here that one monument bears the lyrics for The Wind's Requiem, dedicated to [Zephos](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Zephos), a song that allows you to change the direction of the wind. The other monument, which is broken by the time of *The Wind Waker*, is dedicated to  [Cyclos](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Cyclos), a being capable of creating cyclones that can lift boats and drop them anywhere. Quite a convenient location for flightless birds.

However and whenever Valoo came into the picture, and however and whenever Cyclos' shrine became broken - unknown. I suppose you could spin something like Valoo destroying it on purpose to take his place, or Valoo being a replacement deity for the area - who knows. But his relation to the Rito and their ability to take flight is a bit odd when you consider that the area once housed such a strong alignment with the element of wind.

On track point being: wind is integral to the Rito, and the Rito Champion Revali found a way to ""generate"" an updraft, thus eliminating the need for environmental assistance, or *any* assistance, at all.

\---

**Scales**, then, are the key answer. How do we come to this? I'll tell you what Revali did:

Revali, suffering from whatever attitude displacement or event that gave him such, went looking for a way to become a ""champion"" among his people. One day, while out near the Tabantha Frontier, he noticed the dragon Dinraal and the strange gusts of winds that accompanied it. Could one possess this power? However it came to his knowledge, he discovered that he could pluck a scale from the beast and use in a way - perhaps undiscovered or lost to time - to achieve a method of flight very befitting to his race. And being a skilled archer, he shot and collected a scale from the beast.

So in short: something about **Dragons** seem to accompany flight, or at least Wind. In one connection, Valoo situates himself on Dragon Roost, extremely close to Wind Shrine. In a looser connection, the scales are required to unlike shrines at the various springs, related to Skyward Sword. Gusts of strange wind always accompany dragons, it's not too difficult to shoot a scale off a dragon with a bow, and Rito in the Wind Waker ""could not achieve flight"" unless they had a scale from Valoo.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

As a bonus - **Zora scales**. Suppose Zora and Rito are somehow closely related, outside the implied isolated transformation in the Wind Waker - ""Zora scales"" give their bearers enhanced aquatic movement and abilities, whether held separately or adorned on armor. But are they really ""Zora scales?""

In *Skyward Sword*, you're awarded a suspiciously similar item from Faron, the Water Dragon, called **Water Dragon's Scale**.  It's from a dragon, it's a scale, and it also grants you special abilities - specifically, aquatic based ones.

Is it possible that, having evolved from Zora, the Rito in *The Wind Waker* were already aware magic that could drawn from dragon scales, or scales in general, and thus easily transitioned into Rito life with Valoo?

Another possible revelation is **Jabu**. Suppose, our perception or telling of ""water dragon"" from ""leviathan"" is confused, or rather, they came from the same thing - guardian spirits over water and sky (and thus a link between Rito and Zora, in that regard). Jabu has always had a strangely scaly back - is he the source of scales awarded to Link throughout Ocarina of Time, and thus complete predecessor to the group's guardianship under Valoo?

truezelda,t3_at5leg,The significance of Links blue earrings?,"A small detail, but a reoccurring one. I‚Äôve wondered, what exactly does it symbolize?
My theories: 
Link is a Hylian, and we see these blue earrings in his adult forms from OOT, SS, TP, BoTW. Are these possibly a symbol of Adulthood as a Hylian? Or a symbol of being a Hylian Knight? Maybe it‚Äôs a small gift from Hylia Link possesses when he‚Äôs the chosen hero who will save the land in his life. I‚Äôm not sure, even though it may just be a small minor detail for fashion-choice per se. I honestly think there may be some real significance behind these legendary blue earrings. Are they passed down from generation to generation of a single time line? (SS is the first Link supposedly, then the Hero of Time, Twilight, Wild) but there‚Äôs also Hero‚Äôs who don‚Äôt possess these earrings like the hero of winds. Idk my mind is boggled over this, and I really hope some day we learn some good lore behind these legendary blue earrings that every hero has. What are your thoughts? ",50,public,,0
truezelda,t3_atdiwv,So I had this nifty idea for some BotW post game content,"After beating Ganon, what if every once in a while (maybe after a couple of blood moons or certain amount of in-game days), the main villages of the game get attacked by waves of enemies?

The game doesn't need to have Ganon permanently defeated, you will just need the Star on your profile. To signify a village is being attacked, the Divine Beast's laser beam will turn off, or it will face directly up in the sky, just something different enough to get the player's attention. ^((maybe it takes aim at the village itself lol))

At the respective village, there will be a horde of enemies fighting NPC's at each entrance into the village, so the player will understand what's happening when they enter ^((but they can always climb into the village/shrine warp to skip these guys)). The Champion relative will greet Link and offer them a random enhanced piece of gear from their race. All of the other villagers will be huddled in buildings/locked in their houses. After the talk, the Champion relative will go fight at one entrance of the village and you can choose to help them (where more enemies are) or you can go to the other entrances. After one horde is cleared from one entrance, the Champion relative will go to the next one\*\*, and while transitioning, if you talk to them, they will offer another random piece of gear. Fighting the hordes themselves will probably feel Hyrule Warriors-esque, as the NPC's fighting them will be slow like the NPC travelers in Hyrule. Like the travelers, they can also be knocked out. The hordes will come in waves (max of 3 to 5), getting stronger each time. 

\*\*Rito Village is the odd one out, so the Rito guards will be flying around with their bows and the enemies will come to the main island on the Master Mode balloon rafts, along with the main entrance, where Ritos will use feathered spears. It would be better for Link to use the updrafts to pop the balloons, but the enemies might still land on the main island.

After all the mobs are taken care of, the Champion descendent will tell the player that there's something wrong with the  Divine Beast, so the player will have to go back there. In the Divine Beast, the player must refight the Blight (now with more health) so the laser can turn back on. 

Back to the village, the people are grateful and a small celebration occurs where NPC's give out native food dishes and ingredients/materials. The Champion relative gives you 5 of a gemstone or something even more valuable.

But what happens if the player leaves during the fight? When they come back within the same day, the player can continue the fight, but coming back after a day passes will have the village back to normal, with the Champion relative saying how they were sorry Link had to go (or something less polite depending on the Champion descendant). No reward is given. 

What happens if all of the village guards fail? This will be VERY difficult to achieve, as more guards will spawn out of nowhere to make up for the knocked out guards, but if all of the guards are knocked out, Link will be told to go to the Divine Beast early. The enemies will just hop around the village, not attacking the villagers but hopping and grunting at them up close. 

Blood moons can't occur at a village during an attack. Getting a Game Over will put Link back in the village, needing to do the entire thing over again (from talking to the Champion relative). 

Here is an example of an attack on Zora's Domain:

After beating Ganon, the player notices Vah Ruta's Laser is turned off, so something must be up at Zora's Domain. At all of the entrances, Zora guards with spears are fighting off groups of a few Bokos and a couple of Lizals. Fighting them off, the player finds Sidon at the Mipha Statue with a few guards. Most of the Zora citizens are gathered at the King's room or the shop and hotel. If Link has inventory space, Sidon will give Link a Zora weapon (Zora Spear, Sword, Shield, Silver Bow, Longsword, etc). Sidon goes to the east entrance to fend off the Bokos, and the player follows him. While fighting alongside Sidon, textboxes appear above his head, saying things like ""We can do this!"", ""I believe in you, Link!"", or some other things that Sidon himself would say. After beating the horde at that entrance, talking to Sidon will grant you another Zora weapon. Sidon and his group goes to the other side entrance but the player goes back to the front entrance, where the horde is now mostly Lizals, led by a Moblin. Every entrance has a couple of Zora guards, fighting. The same thing happens for \~2 more waves, with the enemies getting stronger each horde. Every entrance will have \~3 waves. Some Archers will be on random cliffs right outside the city around the second or third wave, so shooting them is also necessary. After all of the enemies are cleared, Sidon asks you to go back to Vah Ruta and take out Waterblight Ganon. Link can just walk up to the edge of the large lake and a textbox will pop up: ""Teleport to Vah Ruta?"" (If the player went to the Divine Beast without beating all of the enemies, the prompt won't appear). When Link goes back in, the enemies and malice will be back, but all the modules are still activated. Link beats Waterblight and after a cutscene or something, Link ends up back in Zora's Domain at nighttime, where the Zoras are celebrating. Some of the NPC's will give Link seafood, others will give him certain fish. Resting at the Hotel is free. Talking to Sidon, he thanks you and gives you 10 Opals (or Luminous Rocks/Sapphires, whatever fits the best as a a reward). 

With small scuffles at the villages, a couple of issues are solved:

* The player can see more of the Champion relative's personality and have more meaningful interactions
* The races themselves would be more memorable if you have to fight alongside them
* More replayability after Ganon
* Some place to actually use a good portion of the player's weapons, instead of keeping the strongest ones constantly in their inventory (I imagine some players will fight mostly Black and Silver enemies at this point in the game)
* Easily getting race-specific gear (I think there's a limited amount of Kite Shields currently)
* Good enemy farming for post game
* Going back to Divine Beast lets players get chests that they missed
* This way, players can refight the Blight bosses in the Divine Beasts in the main game multiple times
* ~~When the Divine Beast lasers are tuned off I can get better pictures of the gorgeous Hyrule~~

Anyways, this was my idea of some extra ""quests"" post-game. I didn't really interact with the Champion relatives after meeting them for the Divine Beast quest, and I think they have potential to be more memorable. Throughout the game, I never had to use up a lot of my weapons for a single camp/boss, because I get more weapons immediately. For the Blights, I know the Illusory Realm is a thing, but I thought it would be more fun if the player had their own gear. 

Maybe something similar can happen in the non-main villages, like in Lurelin and Kakariko? What do you guys think of this idea? Feel free to add anything or point out anything too weird!",2,public,,0
truezelda,t3_at2vyo,Does the Dark World turn good people into weak forms and evil people into strong forms?,"The transformations are part of the Triforce granting Ganon's wish, and I noticed that Blind became a powerful monster while Link became a defenseless bunny.

truezelda,t3_at83gd,I think BotW opened the way to a game set before the flood.,"As we all know, Breath of the Wild broke a lot Zelda conventions. One of which, simple yet meaningful : the green tunic. This is a game where unless you decide to go out of your way and complete every single shrine, you will not see Link's famous green tunic. The tunic is a reward for the most thorough players, and I think most of us were fine with this, right ?


So this got me thinking : for years now, there's been a lot of debate in the community regarding the idea of a Zelda game set before the Great Flood. Which would be an interesting setting for mostly two reasons :

1) It's an era of prosperity for Hyrule, and I think at this point we all want to see an enormous, vibrant Hyrule with great cities and lots of npcs. (Seriously, since Oot, every mainline Zelda game has been post-apo or near).
2) It would be an excuse to see more of WW Ganondorf, at a time where he's in his prime and not a bitter old man. I think everyone agrees that WW Ganondorf has the best characterisation out of them all, and seeing more of him would be quite nice.


Now let's talk about the elephant in the room : the pre-flood era is known as the Era Without a Hero. It's there right in the title ! How can we have a game set before the flood when WW backstory specifically mentions that the hero wasn't there to save Hyrule ? And furthermore : a game where we lose ?


Well, I think BotW opened the way for a game like this. I think in this post-Botw context, a game without Link is a possibility. We've already done away with the tunic, why not do away with Link as well ? We could either play as Zelda herself or a nobody (it could be the introduction of character creation in the Zelda series !).

Of course, Link not being int he game wouldn't be unnoticed. This is an era where everyone worships the Hero of Time. So, much like WW, people would constantly reference the HoT and compare you to him. There'd be statues of him, memorials, maybe even some kind of sidequest where you play the role of the hero in a theatre play... In short, the fact that you are not Link wouldn't be glossed over, it would be part of the story.

And yeah, you technically lose in the end, but you can also see the Flood as a bittersweet win. And it doesn't leave out the possibility of a final battle with Ganondorf. What do you think ?",7,public,,0
truezelda,t3_at7i7l,How would you feel if Nintendo remade A Link to the Past in 3D?,"Apologies if this has been posted already, I don't visit this subreddit too often.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you think if they decided to remake A Link to the Past in 3D? I was thinking after the Link's Awakening remake announcement that I found it strange they have remade almost every mainline Zelda game except for A Link to the Past (A game many would argue to be the quintessential Zelda game) 

&amp;#x200B;

I know A Link Between Worlds started out as a Link to the Past remake but soon became what we have today, so I find it funny they haven't just used that same engine to remake Link to the Past already. But then what if Nintendo decided they should remake that game as 3D. As far as I know I've never heard of a strictly 2D game being created all over again in 3D, and that sounds like something Nintendo would want to experiment with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I would find it really interesting to see that world in 3D (something I've always wanted to do with the 2D games) however I can also see a lot of people being upset that if the game finally gets remade, it would not be true to it's original form.

truezelda,t3_at3sb8,What are your ideas (or hopes) about the settings of future games?,"These do not have to be likely, or even plausible at all, just a fun thread to discuss cool ideas.

My first idea is another game taking place in the land of New Hyrule. 

We don‚Äôt know much about the land itself, except that it‚Äôs large, has pretty generic elemental biomes, and had a large scale ‚ÄòSpirit War‚Äô an unknown amount of time before Link &amp; Tetra‚Äôs arrival.

I believe New Hyrule would be a great place for another game as it is pretty much a clean slate, and the developers don‚Äôt have to worry too much about Geographical integrity and trying to make the world similar to the ~15 other Zelda maps.  There are also similar locations to those on the original Hyrule, so the game won‚Äôt feel too foreign for fans.

Spirit Tracks‚Äô limited lore gives credence to the idea that there weren‚Äôt many inhabitants of the continent due to the Spirit War (Or they fled the continent)  and the Kingdom is only ~100 years old at the start of Spirit Tracks.

A game taking place here could either be further into the future with a more advanced society and technology, or a large scale adventure focusing on exploring these new lands.


I would also enjoy a revisit of Holodrum, Labrynna, or even Termina, which are all popular picks. 

I really just want the world of Zelda to be more fleshed out in general. Is Hyrule and island nation? Has Hyrule been at War with another country? Does Hyrule maintain contact with other nations? 

Also, does anyone know if Hyrule is the actual name of the entire planet/world? It is stated the goddesses created Hyrule, but what about the other lands we know of? Perhaps Hyrule is the name of the entire realm but the areas closest to the monarchy/castle are considered the main  Hyrule.

truezelda,t3_asuskj,Any theories on how Twinrova are alive in the Oracle games?,Did Ganondorf with the full Triforce wish for them to come back to life before being banished in the Dark World? Their dialogue implies that they‚Äôre the same Twinrova from Oot and not new incarnations.,61,public,,0
truezelda,t3_astnea,How do you feel about the rune system?,"Is it necessary? does it screw with much better, previously established item uses? cryonis is literally the same effect an ice arrow had in previous games when coming in contact with water, and with the exception of maybe stasis the rest of the runes could have been replaced with actual items(magic magnet, a bomb slot in the inventory). I think it's either an aesthetic addition to the game OR they simply thought having an infinite amount of those mechanics went well with the idea of an open world game, where you don't have to leave a shrine if you lack bombs or find yourself out of ice arrows.

&amp;#x200B;

They could have easily gone further with this type of game design by making the Master Sword another rune, it charges up like a rune, after all. In other words, my question is, does the rune system conflict with the previously established game's inventory design by giving you always available tools, instead of needing to discover items to complete dungeons or defeat certain enemies? BOTW was my first zelda game and it really screwed with my perception of the series, when i discovered you needed the whistle to defeat a particular boss in the original NES zelda i was weirded out.",11,public,,0
truezelda,t3_asno2l,What exactly happened between OoX and ALBW?,"The intro to ALBW has always struck me as odd. It's supposedly a retelling of the plot to ALttP, but many details are modified: it says Ganon obtained the Triforce by invading the Sacred Realm (""but a thief of notorious repute broke into the Sacred Realm and claimed the Triforce""), which is closer to his original backstory in ALttP, before it was retconned to connect with OoT; more importantly, however, it states that he was ""sealed in darkness"" rather than killed. This whole thing is weird, because ALBW was released after the timeline had been established, so these details seem really out of place.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, even if we accept that the way Ganon acquired the complete Triforce had been lost to time at that point (which is how I've always justified the retcon in my head), his being ""sealed in darkness"" at the end of ALttP just doesn't make any sense. We know Link killed Ganon then, because in the linked ending to OoX we found that Twinrova were trying to revive him all along. They specifically use the word ""revive"", so I think that confirms he was dead. And for that matter, I don't see why Link wouldn't have killed his revived, mindless form as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we could just assume that ""sealed in darkness"", in that particular context, means ""dead"", and that Yuga simply revived him once again. The problem is, as the intro explains, when the Triforce was split after the Hero's victory, a piece of it somehow ""slipped into Ganon's possession"". So, even if we ignore the fact that he snatched it while freaking sealed in darkness, he must have been alive at that point. Right? I don't think we've ever seen a piece of the Triforce being possessed by a dead individual; and, in fact, we literally see the Triforce of Power leaving Ganondorf's body as he dies in TP.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what gives? Is there a lost bit of lore between those games? Or was Ganon not killed at the end of ALttP after all? And by the way, assuming this ""darkness"" he's sealed in in ALBW is a physical place, where would it be? Is it the Dark World? Isn't it restored at the end of ALttP (seeing as it appears as the Sacred Realm in ALBW)?",29,public,,0
truezelda,t3_asiwnb,I hope the next mainline game will stop ruining Ganon,"I'll just get to the point: the post-WW mainline games have been ruining Ganon. In both OoT and WW, Ganon was a very threatening, active, and compelling villain. But since then, he has been continuously been brought further and further from the things that made him interesting since then.

Most people will agree that Ganondorf's portrayal in Twilight Princess is anywhere from unnecessary to barely passable. I actually don't mind the fact that Ganondorf is manipulating Zant; if anything it's better done than in Four Swords Adventures. But for all of Ganondorf's importance, he does shit all in this game. There's no real interaction between him and Zant (even Hyrule Warriors did this right), and he never really does anything to impede or antagonize Link. It's a shame, since when you dig deep into Ganon's lines, he implies that he fed off of Zant's hatred to fuel his power, but unfortunately, it seems that they took the wrong idea from this to develop, as this was the start of reducing Ganondorf from a man consumed with ambition to the embodiment of hatred.

Skyward Sword unfortunately took Ganon's position as ""literal evil incarnate"" into high gear. It takes the idea that Ganon is powered by hatred, then runs with it in the biggest waste of an explanation ever: Ganon is practically the Antichrist, and he's the hatred incarnate of the Zelda universe's embodiment of evil. Again, there's nothing wrong with this by itself, but the fact they decide to virtually override Ganondorf's motivation as a human (power for its own sake) with something much simpler is just insulting. It also didn't help that Demise, Ganon's predecessor, had all of the same problems that Ganondorf himself had in Twilight Princess: being important in the story, yet doing nothing of note and just showing up for a boss fight.

Breath of the Wild unfortunately follows Skyward Sword's lead in characterizing Ganon. Somehow, they make it a point to forget how Ganondorf was a power-hungry king of thieves who manipulated and planned his way to get power, and instead make him an ancient reincarnating evil who takes many forms. But again, that's fine; they absolutely can take this new angle with Ganon if both Ganondorf I and Ganondorf II have been played out. The real problem was how they did shit-all with this idea. They explain absolutely nothing about where this Ganon came from, what form he originally took, nor how he became a mass of dark energy. Given how much they emphasize background details and lore, it's just so glaring to see Ganon have nothing beyond ""he reincarnates and plagues Hyrule"" when Zelda and the obligatory one-shots get quite a bit of development.

I really get the feeling that the cause is Yoshiaki Koizumi leaving Zelda for Mario. Which I don't really blame him for; Mario has more money on the line. Wind Waker was the last game where Koizumi had any involvement, and Ganon was inarguably at his best there: he had an actual starting motivation, really affected the plot, and showed how unstoppable he is without being out-gambitted by King Daphnes. Now that Koizumi is gone and the Zelda team shuffles out different people who write the scenarios, they're floundering around with Aonuma and Fujibayashi's ideal of Ganondorf being some shallow reincarnation of evil.

I just want Ganon to be an actual character again; not a plot device incarnation of evil, not an egregious Orcus on his Throne, but actually doing something. Acting to advance the plot and punishing the heroes' mistakes. Fleshing out his character through interaction with others. This is who Ganon deserves to be.

I'm not asking for Ganon to be the next MCU Thanos or Erik Killmonger. They can develop the angle of Ganon going mad with power and degenerating (not doing so in BotW was such as missed opportunity). They can make him a manipulator who works behind the scenes through a proxy before revealing himself. Hell, they can even develop his role as the Zeldaverse's Antichrist. He just needs to be a compelling villain who acts on the plot and with understandable goals and motivations. They've really made an effort to improve on Zelda since the end of the N64 era; let's see Ganon get the same amount of love.",74,public,,0

truezelda,t3_armh73,Is unsheathing/sheathing the Master Sword from the back physically possible?,"The Master Sword is very long. Due to its placement on Link's back, unsheathing it requires Link to grab the hilt and pull the sword out, moving his hand diagonally up and to the left (or right). But considering the sheer length of the sword, I feel that this would require Link to extend his arm out in that direction more than is physically possible, all while maintaining a grip on the sword, which would be awkward while the arm is fully extended. The sword seems to be at least 3 feet long, if not more. I can see how this would be possible with shorter swords, but not the Master Sword.

truezelda,t3_armog3,What do you guys want in the next main line Zelda game?,"It‚Äôs going to be really hard to top breath of the wild I think, mainly because of the huge scope of the game. I really wouldn‚Äôt mind another game similar to BoTW in terms of scope and gameplay, because I think what makes a Zelda game Zelda is the adventure/ exploration and Nintendo really nailed that in BoTW. The one thing that hugely let me down in BoTW though was the dungeons. I think the divine beasts were integral to the story and were interesting concepts, but when I think back to TP dungeons or OOT dungeons I feel like these fell flat. I suppose this was made up for with the inclusion of side quests and mini-dungeons and stuff, I just feel like Nintendo missed out by not including super specific niche dungeons like the spirit temple for example. I guess my main grief is not that these dungeons weren‚Äôt fun, just that they weren‚Äôt as memorable as many other aspects of the game.

How would you feel if the next Zelda was, say, 40$, and took place in the same Hyrule with the same engine, but was set 5 or so years later with all the settlements rebuilt and flourishing?

Hyrule Castle and the town below would be rebuilt, older villages would have turned into large almost city-like settlements, and the ruins around the world would be ruins no longer.

The story could be about reclaiming other parts of the land with Zelda, and there would be a large variety of new weapons, armor, etc. A new, leader villain could be the antagonist, with the story focusing on Zelda and Link‚Äôs relationship (which, for bonus storytelling points, could be reflected through the growth of Hyrule) and this new villain.

truezelda,t3_aroh0n,[SPOILERS] FSA=OoT,"I havent seen anyone talk about this yet
So let me bring it to the table

MC is a prequel to FS
And both are prequels to FSA
But FSA is not a ""sequel"" (after TP) to OoT but a game that happens at the same time on a diferent timeline.

The official timeline is weird and full of plot holes (whatever). But FSA has nothing to do with TP, because Ganondorf is death by the end of TP (not sealed as in a bunch of other games).

During the late game of SS, The Imprisoned keeps evolving and getting stronger, so, Link goes to Skyloft, collects the whole Triforce piece by piece (preventing it from shatering and getting inside some other 2 people just as in OoT), then he wishes to destroy The Imprisoned  (or something like that) and the whole island falls to the ground making a Demise pancake in the process.

Everything cool, until Ghirahim takes Zelda to the past using the Gate of Time, and using her to reawaken Demise, Link does his thing and kills him. Done! SS is over, and all it took was to kill Demise twice, once during the time he created the master sword using the goddess sword and he took the triforce to Hyrule.

While in the past, where a Link from the future comes out of nowhere to kill Demise, makes this timeline future yet to be born Zelda not getting kidnapped by a tornado and the yet to be born Link not doing anything from SS (as the Master Sword and the Triforce).

Years after (during the past timeline), MC takes place everything as well as its intro, the people from the sky gave the humans the the sword and the Golden Power.

During MC, your quest is to restore the Picori Blade to seal the monsters away. But if you think about it, you do more than just restoring it, you forge the blade with some magical elements hidden inside the temples and transform the plain old blade into the Four Sword (just as in SS).

But thats not all. We know that during FSA your main goal is to defeat Vaati, but then, during your trip to the Gerudo Desert, you are told about Ganondorf, a man born amongst the gerudo, told to be the king by the customs of them.

During OoT they don't seem to mind about Ganondorf, just as during FSA, but we know that the gerudos don't aprove him doing whatever he wants, (i'm stretching this as far as i can) Urbosa herself says it's her responsability to stop Ganon, who happened to be the king of the Gerudo. Just as in FSA, the gerudos disaprove Ganondorf trying to take over the world, but not doing too much to stop him, maybe because they dont think he will do too much... why tho? Because he has never done it before, nor tried it.

After OoT everyone knows about Ganondorf and him evil and trying to steal the triforce and all that. But only after OoT, they don't seem to mind before he kills the king and rules over Hyrule, just as in FSA. FSA is the first time Ganondorf has been born, the first time he goes evil and tries to get the triforce, that's why no one knows about his plans. There were 2 Ganondorfs, the one who appears in OoT and all its timelines, and the one in FSA.

Now, once again, MC-FS-FSA happen in a diferent timeline than OoT, as well as OoT and FSA taking place at the exact time during their respective timelines. The Four Sword and the Master Sword were the Goddess Sword at some time.",0,public,,0
truezelda,t3_argyew,How likely are the Link and Zelda of each game to end up together?,"I'm interested in your opinions, here are mine, but their just opinions:

Skyward Sword: 99.9% I mean, they are the most obvious one to be a couple, I don't know if it's canon but it seems to be heavily implied.  
Minish Cap: 50% To me there are a few reasons for this being high. One, they already have a good relationship that seems to go back their entire lives. Two, Link comes from a well established family since his grandfather is old chums with the King. Three, it seems to be a very young and small Kingdom so it doesn't matter too much if the Princess marries a commoner.  
Four Sword:	  25%				I don't see much plotwise, but I feel like Hyrule is still a small kingdom, and it seems that Zelda and Link already have some prior relationship, not necessarily romantic.  
Ocarina of Time: 0%	I mean there are three timeline splits, in one Link is dead, in one he is removed from the timeline, and in the last one he is nobody to the people of Hyrule, he probably marries the ranch girl.    
Twilight Princess: 5%		I don't see much of anything between them. Honestly in most of these scenarios I imagine that Link and Zelda would at least be friends or something, but not in this game, because there seems to be no real camaraderie or connection between Zelda and Link. Besides, Link seems to already have a romantic interest.  
Four Sword Adventures: 25%		Pretty much the same as Four Sword I guess  
Link to the Past: 65%			Unless I'm mistaken, ALBW hints to a relationship between these two. I feel like Links fate after LA is uncertain, so it really depends on whether the relationship happens before or after LA
Oracle of Whatever: 5%			Zelda and Link don't even seem to know each other   
Link Between Worlds: 15%		I don't see much of a romantic relationship between the two in this game, I might be wrong since I'm not entirely familiar with it   
Legend of Zelda &amp; Adventure of Link: ? 		This is a special case, since there is one Link with two Zeldas. Personally, Link has a kiss with the AOL Zelda, so that has a good chance. Though I've seen good theories for the opposite.   
Wind Waker: 5%	I don't see a romantic relationship between Link and Tetra, I always see them as being friends, maybe some one sided feelings, bit I really don't see a relationship between them     
Spirit Tracks: 65%				I just get a good feeling from these two, it reminds me of the Zelda and Link from Minish Cap, except they get to spend more time together.    
Breath of the Wild: 75%			I'm not really well versed on this pair because I never played the game, but I feel like they are comparable to the pair from Skyward Sword, (re)building the Kingdom of Hyrule.

truezelda,t3_arcb2m,Link's Awakening (Switch) to have multiplayer component?,"According to the [official website](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-switch), and as reported at [nintendolife](http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/number_of_players_for_links_awakening_on_switch_to_be_determined), the number of players is, ""To be determined"".

If this was just a 1:1 remake, why would that be even in question?

Many people here speculated before the announcement that a new 2D Zelda game on Switch would incorporate multiplayer in some way. Perhaps that's still the case?

truezelda,t3_ar2v0q,Why the artsyle used in LA?,"I‚Äôve been thinking about the new art style in LA, and why Nintendo would choose to use something so toylike.

It‚Äôs already been mentioned that the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô prologue and epilogue scenes use a more ‚Äòanime‚Äô style while the dreamworld of Koholint Island has an unreal, toy-like quality. This I think is part of the reason, but not the only one.

The core narrative of Link‚Äôs Awakening relies on the player growing attached to the world they find themselves in before it‚Äôs revealed that Link‚Äôs quest to return home will destroy it. The cutesy style is designed to tug on our heartstrings: the developers want to make us want to protect this world and it‚Äôs inhabitants. Picking a style that invokes those feelings towards Marin and the other inhabitants of Koholint is important.

The sweet art style is also in *contrast* to the bitter tale being told. It‚Äôs not until the player is halfway through the game that the dark twist will be revealed, and I think that by making the world so lighthearted it will make the sudden revelation hit even harder.

Additionally, I think the style is purposely supposed to draw comparisons away from Breath of the Wild. Nintendo don‚Äôt want to give the impression that this is a grand epic with sweeping vistas to explore. Link‚Äôs Awakening is a tight story set in a small world and the art style makes that immediately clear. It‚Äôs a sales pitch, one that tells the player the kind of game to expect.

And finally - and somewhat cynically - the art style will sell toys. They‚Äôre practically already designed, and I can see the simple little figurines that this game will sell.

Are there any other reasons you see for the art style? Is there a style that you think might have achieved these goals better?",89,public,,0

That being said it has been years since I have initially played it, so some of my memories may be a bit fuzzy. Here‚Äôs some changes I‚Äôd like to see for the remake:


‚Ä¢ Have the ability to have more than just two items equipped. Give the sword a dedicated button, and upgrades such as the power bracelet shouldn‚Äôt need to be equipped, just automatically applied. Now that there are a lot more buttons to work with, there shouldn‚Äôt be a need to fiddle with the items menu so much.


‚Ä¢ For the photographs, give us the option to share them on social media. Perhaps give us a way to make them our own.


‚Ä¢ An extra dungeon or two would be really nice. The DX version had an extra dungeon but it was incredibly short from what I remember. Make a dungeon which goes beyond the GB hardware limitations.


‚Ä¢ Retain the trading quest. Discovering the use of the final item was one of my favorite parts of the game.

So the main goal to explore the island is to find 8 instruments to help wake the whale fish at the top of the mountain.

- cajon (box drum) 
- obeo
- flute
- suspended cymbal
- clarinet
- windchimes
( I don't know the rest)

Do you think they will be replacing these instruments for the instruments found in the dungeons? Like that's why you explore the dungeons in the first place to find the instruments, to help Marin sing to awake whale fish.

He becomes her appointed knight by the King's orders (mentioned in Zelda's diary), but how did he know Zelda prior to being her appointed knight?

Speaking of the Master Sword: Is it ever revealed what Link went through to find or ""prove himself"" as the bearer of the Master Sword?

But Overall, this really isn't how LA was meant to look IMO. Sure, it wasn't a super mature looking game, but lookingat the concept art it was sort of epic vibe like a 90s anime sort of. I think Link's design is super ugly. I think the soundtrack remaster is downright offensive. To take such classic tunes from an amazing soundtrack and make them sound like something out of Yoshi's New-Island.

I know a lot of people didn't play the original growing upa nd that's fine, but whether you agree with me or not, seeing something you really loved as a kid just be completely misrepresented (at least to me), and see the majority of people praising it or calling people who are upset a windwaker situation when it's totally different just dissapoints me.

truezelda,t3_apahvs,The Age of Fire and Iron,"*Part One: [King in the Mountain](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/agx4nw/king_in_the_mountain/)*

*Part Two: [The Ancient Children of the Forest](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/ak8scb/the_ancient_children_of_the_forest/)*

Fire and iron. Their discoveries are milestones in the history of the human race. They are symbols of advancing technology. 

What about the ancient humans living in the Era of the Goddess Hylia? Did something similar happen in their history?

Take a look at the [door to the Earth Temple](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/1405887.jpg?952). What do you see?

**The Blessings of the Mountain**

&gt;Yes... This mountain was not always such a dangerous and unforgiving place.

&gt;There was a time when those above-ground and those below lived together in harmony by the blessing of the great mountain. The desolation that you see now is all that remains to remind us of those glorious days...

&gt;- Eldin, Fire Dragon 

The glory days of the Eldin Volcano region, when the mountain wasn't such a dangerous place. By the blessing of the great mountain, those who lived below, the Mogma, lived in harmony with those who lived above-ground. Who were they?

As Part One of this series highlighted, the architecture of the Fire Sanctuary points to someone other than the Gorons. While they may have helped, the ancient king, connected to the Fire Sanctuary, was symbolised by different birds. Birds are connected to the Goddess Hylia, but as Part Two of this series made clear, the ancient humans of the forest took the bird symbol as their own. Therefore, those above-ground, who lived in harmony with the Mogmas and the Gorons, were the ancient humans.

The Mountain region may have been less dangerous back then, but it was still a very different environment to the ancient forest the humans had called home. Not only were the physical surroundings different, but so were the races, spirits, and creatures that inhabited it. Hylia may have turned their gaze skyward, but stepping out into the world expanded their minds. 

What are some of the things the ancient humans learned?

&gt;Master, this is Eldin Volcano. It is an active volcano rich with the power of the earth.

&gt;- Fi

The Mogmas, and perhaps the Gorons, would have taught them about mining. Mogmas are treasure hunters who dig through the ground, and the Gorons are famous for their mining activities throughout the games. The mountain is rich in resources, and there are many [underground tunnels](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/a/a2/Sword_0979.jpg?width=640) and caverns that have been [excavated](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14/Walkthrough/04/0413.jpg) throughout it. What kind of resources were the humans mining?

&gt;Us Mogmas have claimed this territory to search around for riches. We're what you'd call treasure hunters. **There are loads of these red, blue, and green stones called Rupees around here**. Sometimes you can even find silver and gold ones too. And while they ain't technically treasure, **you can also find these tough mineral chunks. I bet you could use'em to make stuff.**

&gt;- Mogma

I bet you could too. 

So, there are rupees, which come from Rupee Ore:

&gt;You see the shining stone sticking out of the wall? That's pure Rupee Ore! It's also why there are so many Rupees to dig up here.

&gt;- Tubert

And, the much more important ""tough mineral chunks"":

&gt;**Eldin Ore**

&gt;This hard concretion sparkles brightly. It also **has lots of different uses**.

It doesn't take much imagination to see how the discovery of Eldin Ore contributed to the advancement of the ancient humans. The native Bomb Flowers would have helped them in their mining process. The heat of the volcano would have helped them to extract the metal from the ore, and then to forge it.

The blessings, or resources, of the mountain helped to forge the humans themselves. They still respected nature, but they weren't the children of the forest anymore. 

We can see their changed view of the world, and the respect they still had, in the architecture of the Earth Temple.

**Fearsome Guardians of the Earth**

&gt;This is the Earth Temple. Signs indicate it was built here because of the subterranean caverns below.

&gt;Just as at Skyview Temple, many defensive mechanisms were built here to discourage would-be intruders.

&gt;- Fi

The Earth Temple was built for a similar reason to the Skyview Temple - to protect the sacred Spring. The [Earth Spring](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/8089075_orig.jpg) is located [deep underground](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/1/10/Earth_Spring_2.png?version=5ea306c9072f4b206f252d19090ebbed). Just like the Sky Spring, it is a sacred place connected to the Goddess Hylia. And, just as the Goddess would have directed the ancient humans of the forest to build the Skyview Temple, she would have directed the ancient humans now living on the mountain to build the Earth Temple. 

However, the architecture of the Earth Temple is very different to that of the Skyview Temple. Whereas plants, the sky, and birds featured prominently in the Skyview Temple, [dragons](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/6087105_orig.jpg), [elephants](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/7127167.jpg?1490641450), [lizards or salamanders](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ4oEixj1_2rtF6rd9s4GmsNY9cOgrA8wHyEU2_IzobTzRF9119), and [demonic](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/7/7a/Sword_1274.jpg?width=640) looking [fearsome guardians](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/5822921_orig.png) decorate the Earth Temple. 

These images must represent the creatures and spirits that the society living on the mountain had come to deeply respect. Just as the Skyview Temple connected the Forest and the Sky, the Earth Temple highlights the connection between Earth and Fire, which is fitting since it's located within a volcano.

It's important to note that the fearsome looking guardians are not actually demons. They actually represent good spirits, or deities, in a fierce or wrathful form. How can we be sure?

In the SS art book section of the Hyrule Historia, director Fujibayashi says about the Eldin Volcano region:

&gt;The dungeon design was based off Southeast Asian architecture and coloring, which is why you see extensive use of vibrant, primary colors.

Throughout Southeast Asia, and other parts of Asia, [statues](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/geant-grand-palais.jpeg?1502655723) and [images](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/5958200_orig.jpg) similar to the fearsome looking guardians in the Earth Temple can be found. These are the [fierce deities of Buddhism](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fierce_deities). They are the protector gods of the Buddhist religion.

In one room where you fight some Lizalfos, there are three fierce deities surrounding the chamber. One can be seen [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/2590010_orig.jpg). Note the gestures they are making with their hands? These are a reference to [mudra](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudra), ritual gestures used in the Buddhist and Hindu religions. 

Other Buddhist symbols referenced in the Earth Temple include the [Dharma Wheel](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmachakra), with its eight spokes, found [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/4526974_orig.jpg), and the sacred lotus flower - https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_(attribute), found [here](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/2206927.jpg?434).

Whew, I warned you that SS had a lot of references to Buddhism, and we haven't even got to the Ancient Cistern yet!

Dragons, lizards, and [salamanders](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/adnjez/why_vah_rudania_is_a_salamander/) have well established connections to fire and earth in mythology, but why elephants? One possibility could be the Japanese Buddhist god [Kangiten](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangiten). This elephant-headed god was probably derived from the Hindu god Ganesha. Kangiten can be known as the ""remover of obstacles, but when propitiated, he bestows material fortunes, prosperity, success and health."" The rich material fortunes of the Eldin region, and the increase in technology, may be a reason why the ancient humans connected the elephant to the Earth Temple. 

**Rise of the Humans**

To conclude, let's go back to the [entrance of the Earth Temple](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/1405887.jpg?952). What do you see? Two images of a dragon, and a locking mechanism wrought from iron, or some other metal. A fitting symbol of what the ancient humans had learned, and gained, by coming to the mountain. A new respect for the powerful elements of Earth and Fire, and the knowledge of how to use them. The humans themselves are the ones being forged by Hylia. She led them out of the forest, and they made their way to the mountain. Where will she next lead them?

When you think of mining in SS, what's the first place that comes to mind?

**An Important Distinction**

While both are found within the Eldin Volcano region, the architecture of the Earth Temple is very different to that of the Fire Sanctuary. There's a couple of reasons for this, that are important to understanding the history of the ancient humans. I believe that the Fire Sanctuary was built much later than the Earth Temple. The Fire Sanctuary contains a [mural depicting the Temple of Time in the Lanayru region](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/7006313_orig.png). I believe that the humans first went to the Eldin Volcano region before the Lanayru region, as I hope will become more clear in the next post. Therefore, the Fire Sanctuary must have been built at a later date. Also, compared to the Ancient Cistern, the Fire Sanctuary seems to have been built exclusively to hide the Sacred Flame. I believe Hylia gave this task much later in the history of the Era of the Goddess. I'll come back briefly (hopefully) to the Eldin region one last time, to discuss these matters in further detail.

truezelda,t3_apacov,The worst part about the item management system in BotW...,"It's not the fact that weapons break *all the time* (although that is annoying.)

But rather, it's the fact that there are all these elemental weapons that aren't meant to be used as your 'main' weapon.

I can't count the amount of times I've started a battle, switched to my blizzard rod, used it once, switched to my great flamesword, used it twice, and then switched back.

It's especially tedious considering I find it really useful to combo ice weapons with a great flamesword (it does *so much* extra damage to frozen enemies) and yet I have to wait for the swinging animation to finish before I can switch back because the game can't cue weapon switches until Link finishes his animation.

It all *makes sense*, but there were times that I was very tempted to just throw all my elemental weapons away and only use standard weapons because it was easier to manage. I miss mapping secondary weapons to additional buttons and I'd enjoy using elemental rods and weapons a lot more if I could switch between them without opening up a menu.

Anyway, that was my stupid rant about some minor problem in BotW. I recently replayed it, and it was really enjoyable despite its minor problems.",36,public,,0
truezelda,t3_ap44oq,Could a hypothetical remake of TLOZ survive modern day with its story faithfully in-tact?,"I was thinking about what it might look like if Nintendo ever remade the original LOZ, and while I think it'd be interesting if Nintendo went completely wild and changed all sorts of things about the dungeons and items and whatnot to make them more like modern Zelda games, the one thing I'd be really worried about them touching would be the story.

Do you think it's even possible for Nintendo to remake TLOZ and not have the story filled with retcons?  Naturally the way it's told would need to be updated to modern standards.  A big infodump at the beginning, end, and in the manual would not fly for a modern game story.  There would probably need to be more dialogue and more cutscenes (at least more than the approximately none that exist in the original), but I don't know that Nintendo would be capable of doing that while maintaining the original setting and plot of the original.  The original game's story was written in a time when game stories were very minimalistic.  Would that story even hold up today without modification?

Every time they've attempted full-fledged remakes (rather than just HD remasters) in the past, they've gotten way too carried away and ended up with completely different games (Link's Awakening, Oracle Games, A Link Between Worlds).  I'm not saying that hasn't resulted in more interesting games, but it does make me wonder about Nintendo's ability to actually make a proper remake.  Would they even be capable of it?  I'd be interested to hear what people think.  Or if a remake of TLOZ, for its story to be told through a modern lens, is something people would even want to see.",52,public,,0

truezelda,t3_aok5ur,My Problem with Skyward Sword's swordplay and combat,"I don't take issues with the motion controls per se. I have never had issues with the motion controls that couldn't be fixed with a quick recalibration in the menu.

No, my issue is what they did with the motion controls. Skyward Sword promised full motion controlled swordplay, but that's not what we got. Instead, what we can do is control the direction of the slash, and nothing else. We don't control the sword - everything you do with the sword could easily be replicated with buttons and a control stick. 

I don't really know what they could have done to improve that. But even so, that's not my biggest issue with the swordplay. My biggest issue is that the enemies are all much worse as a result. There are so many fights in the game that feel exactly the same - an enemy walks up to you, awkwardly holding its weapon in one direction, and you just have to pick the direction to slice. Again and again and again - from Bokoblins to Demise. Is this really the best they could do with motion controlled swordplay? Why is it that Wii Sports Resort has better swordfights than Zelda? Not to mention it makes the shield completely overpowered, because shield parries are ridiculously easy to do in this game and they are the correct response to literally any attack from a sword wielder. 

Apologies if this comes off as too critical. Just to be clear, I have a lot of fondness for Skyward Sword, and I enjoy a lot of it. But this is just another part of the game that felt like it could be so amazing and just... failed. Just like the beautiful but empty sky or the almost-badass-except-for-the-fucking-toes Imprisoned or the way the game completely wastes Demise, the origin of basically all evil in Zelda.

My first game was Phantom Hourglass and despite everyone calling it the weakest I loved every second of it (except the blowing part) but I was curious on where all the other characters were, since I could only find Toon Link. I looked into Brawl's trophy descriptions and I discovered Twilight Princess, which was my next game, and if I loved PH you bet I loved TP even more, after that I went for Wind Waker and realized it was a prequel to PH, I though it was odd that there were 2 games taking place in the sea and another in land, more with their order of release, since TP was in the middle, later a friend started explaining how they were all connected and introduced me to Hyrule Historia aaaaaaand I never looked back.

truezelda,t3_ao9oak,"Probably old news, but is the Final Trial inside the Master Cycle Zero?","I just finished The Champion's Ballad DLC for Breath of the Wild, and I noticed something when I got the map for the Final Trial.

Check out the [map](https://youtu.be/yNFVXUjXdeA?t=19). When I first played the Final Trial I thought it was just a general mishmash of ideas, but when I look at it now I can't help but notice how similar it looks to a [combustion engine](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQ2hKwE3goNZs9V9E8yuUmcHaUPjG5xiWue7kVtfLXvYw/1.jpg), like you'd find in a car or motorbike. Obviously the Final Trial isn't an exact replica of a real-world engine, but the central shafts and connecting rods are there. There's even a [fan](https://youtu.be/yNFVXUjXdeA?t=337).

I'm sure someone better versed in modern motor engineering than me can explain what all the different components of the Final Trial are supposed to represent rather than me going 'yeah that kind of looks like a thing from an engine', but I thought it made sense thematically. The Master Cycle Zero is supposed to be the fifth Divine Beast and the other four 'dungeons' all take place within a Divine Beast. I quite enjoy the feeling that I'm 'putting back together' the engine of the MCZ before I get to ride it.

I suppose the only question is this: When Link enters the Final Trial, does he (and the Shrine of Resurrection) shrink, or is the MCZ 'naturally' big and Maz Koshia has shrunk it down? Maz Koshia seems to have growth powers, and he can cause himself to grow to unnatural sizes.

truezelda,t3_aoc323,"When you think about it, Zant is just a bad imitation of Majora's Skull Kid","Think about it: they are childishly immature, both were outcasted by society for their selfish desires, they chanced upon a source of dark power, they use that dark power to take over the land and do random acts of cruelty, and at the last minute they get tossed aside by the dark power when they have outlived their usefulness.

Skull Kid and Zant are a lot more similar than many realize. Which makes it a good opportunity to look at what Skull Kid does right and Zant does wrong given that Skull Kid is considered one of the series' best villains while Zant really isn't.

The main thing that Skull Kid does well is that he's a very humanized, tragic figure. Skull Kid's reason for his villainy is just very believable: he's frustrated, alone, and needs friends. Skull Kid was clearly outcasted by society, and befriending Tatl and Tael while coming across Majora's Mask set him on the road to villainy. Ultimately, Skull Kid realizes the error of his ways after Majora leaves him, and decides to befriend Link and celebrate the Carnival of Time with the rest of Termina. This is a very believable and human character arc, something that permeates much of Majora's Mask, but Skull Kid really captures this spirit.

Zant on the other hand definitely had potential as a humanized, tragic madman who descended to madness. The main problem that Zant has is that there's barely anything to suggest that this is a believable motive. The Twili by themselves are very powerful and advanced inside the Twilight Realm, and while Light Spirit Lanayru implies that some of the Twili could have been driven insane by the Interlopers' banishment, the Twili are universally peaceful and unassuming other than Zant. It would have been a lot more effective if Zant had some supporters who knew of the Twili's initial imprisonment, but since the Twili are silent and peaceful, nothing ever really comes of this.

Even as an irredeemable monster like Majora, Zant still fails to stack up. And this is for two reasons.

The first reason is that Majora has a very clear goal: spread and relish in suffering, then destroy all of existence. Majora never deviates from this goal, and while it's never outright stated, you can clearly see that this is what Majora wants above all else. On the other hand, Zant never really has a clear goal. Yes, it's clear that he wants power, but everything he does doesn't seem to support that. He just does random acts of cruelty just because he can.

The second reason is that while Majora clearly affects the world and the world reacts, Zant doesn't really do the same. When Majora and Skull Kid send the moon to drop on Termina, everyone pays attention and reacts in their own unique way. Most of the Clock Towners panic, the Carpenter Boss decides to stay, Cremia, Romani, Anju, and Kafei decide to face their doom with dignity, the list just goes on about how the characters react in their own way. On the other hand, the people of Twilight era Hyrule don't really seem to care about what Zant is doing. I don't mind them being unaware of Zant's existence, but come on, was that really an excuse for the Twilight to do effectively nothing to its victims? They can still touch and interact with things.

Anyway, this is just something I thought about when people compare the ""darkness"" of both Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess. TP in general just doesn't have the solid character writing that backs up its dark tones, and I think the comparison between Skull Kid and Zant serves to showcase this well.",0,public,,0

They tend to make the mistake of filling the world with Rupees, Heart Pieces, collectibles that ultimately lead to Rupees (Gold Skulltulas, Golden Bugs, Poes), and materials, but those rewards are repetitive and piddling.

But honestly, it was Capcom that perfected the art of coming up with a ""world filler"" for Zelda: and that's the [Rings](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Magical_Ring). These Rings had a wide variety of functions: increasing damage with a boomerang, replacing the spin attack with a sword beam, increasing damage taken and given, decreasing damage taken and given, immunity to curses, erratic sword damage, quicksand immunity, find double rupees or hearts, increase seed duration, the list goes on.

Unlike the repetitive rewards of rupees and heart pieces, these rings almost always have some kind of alteration to Link's capabilities, making it fun to try a lot of them and see how they fit your playstyle. What's more, a lot of these rings even have their own drawbacks to complement their enhancements, such as decreasing your defense while increasing your attack, or sacrificing some health to do more damage. It's almost RPG-like.

I know that the Zelda team has tried to bring back some aspects of the Rings into recent Zelda games such as the Medals in SS and the Armor Set bonuses in BotW, but those are honestly really watered down in comparison to the variety that the Rings offered. Most of the time, these watered-down imitations of the ring system often have no drawbacks to them, meaning that there isn't really any incentive to try new playstyles by equipping different things.

If I were to bring the Ring system back, I'd definitely get rid of the cosmetic rings like the Victory and Friendship rings as well as the need to ""appraise"" the rings before they are activated. They should also incorporate the crafting system to allow for ringmaking, allowing you to bring requisite materials and Rupees to a ringsmith so that they can make them for you. We should also be able to have duplicates of Rings as well as the ability to equip more than one at a time; four would be a good number, though the standard RPG convention of two would also work. This way, we would have the ability to stack duplicates to craft our own playstyle.

The Ring System is definitely something I wouldn't mind seeing 200 of in a Zelda game, unlike Heart Pieces or Rupees. I know it makes Zelda a bit too RPG-ish, but I think the series really needs to go in that direction if they need to come up with better ways to fill a world (which BotW did).",132,public,,0
truezelda,t3_amzuym,What do most people consider to be canon or non-canon?,"This is a simple discussion thread, not starting any wars or fights, but what do you consider to be canon or not? Whether it be the books, the games, games' manuals, remakes and remasters, interviews, etc.

EDIT: My personal view

Personally games and their manuals are the most important, the books contain too many errors to be used as a *good* or reliable source, interviews can be trusted, but it depends because it's possible that the interviewee is either ""bullshitting"", doesn't know, has previous information that is no longer true to the games and their stories, etc etc. Remakes or remasters are probably more reliable than the original games because they could introduce new additions to the story, change the world, fox translations or add text, etc, although remasters don't add too much (because they're usually just upscales of the original, like resolution enhancements or re-textures, etc.) I think they could get a pass if the changes aren't *too* big or don't add too much.",16,public,,0

truezelda,t3_amxdad,Would Majora's Mask have worked were it not a sequel?,"The way this game succeeds spectacularly at it's every aim fascinates me, it is the definition of a perfect storm. This game had everything stacked against it and managed to turn that into a strength. A big factor in that is how much it leans on OoT, most obviously for the assets, but also for the world. It's the furthest thing from a traditional Zelda game, but the bizzaro world nature of Termina makes it feel so much more surreal because it almost feels like you've been there before. It feels like a distorted memory of Hyrule played out in a dream. For me, Termina has never actually felt like it was a real location, it was always this abstract metaphorical version of some distant reality, like this world itself was a crooked shadow of some reality that actually was- well, real. Like you were playing the role of a character in a fictional story being read aloud in a higher world. If that makes sense. Like, I've seen that person before, I've been to this location- but no wait, it's a little different. It's like a trippy bad dream where the logic and nature of everything is just a little bit off. The whole game rests on that sense of uncomfortable dissonance between what you've presumably experienced just before this, and what you're experiencing now. Like Majora is the second part of a two part set. 

It's such a brilliant game for so many other reasons I'm sure it would still be amazing, but like every other element of it, it uses it's real life circumstances to give it a leg up. It truly takes advantage of the fact that it's a sequel in the most creative way I've ever seen. I'm not sure how much it's existence improves OoT, but I wonder if anyone's ever played MM as their first Zelda game and had it totally fall flat.

truezelda,t3_ame54g,"At the end of Skyward Sword, where exactly is the final confrontation with Demise taking place?","I've been thinking about this for a little while, but I'm curious about the exact location of the final battle with Demise. It's basically a very serene setting with clear water on the ground reflecting the blue sky, until Demise makes the sky red and starts a thunderstorm. This video for reference for how the arena looks like:

[https://youtu.be/r580S90NECo?t=34](https://youtu.be/r580S90NECo?t=34)

It's obvious that this place originally had this blue sky and serene setting, until Demise corrupted it for the final battle, so I don't think that this place is some kind of spontaneous invention by Demise. Is this perhaps how the Sacred Realm originally looked like, and where Zelda and Link (or Rauru) eventually decided to hide the Triforce in? It seems appropriate enough to me to be a realistic possibility.

Another thought I had about this place is that it is perhaps the same place as seen in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess, where Zelda plays the ocarina and recieives the light arrows respectively?

For references, this is what these places look like:

Ocarina of Time: [https://youtu.be/ge8zd1ZR-hc?t=100](https://youtu.be/ge8zd1ZR-hc?t=100)

Twilight Princess: [https://youtu.be/dUgIW6y9OWU?t=944](https://youtu.be/dUgIW6y9OWU?t=944)

These places has the same kind of serenity to them as the place originally had in Skyward Sword, and overall feel pretty similiar and sacred to me. Could they perhaps be the same place as seen in Skyward Sword? It would also feel pretty epic if the place were the first great evil was defeated, also happens to be the same place as where the timeline split occurred.

The Ocarina of Wind shares similarities with the Ocarina of Time (and the Flute in ALTTP too). When Link plays it, it warps him, like the Ocarina of Time does. I know the Flute from ALTTP inspired the instrument for OOT but is there any connection between those 3 ? Are they the same ? Maybe the Royal Family gave the instrument to the wind tribe (to hide it ?) after the sealing of the Temple of Time, and they gave it to the chosen one in Minish Cap to help him in his quest. Link then gave back the ocarina to the Royal Family and, later, the Sheikah worked on some melodies that were passed through ages to the tribe, finally to teach these to the Hero of Time. In the Downfall, the ocarina lost his full-glory power from OOT and needed again the help of a bird to warp Link in ALTTP.

truezelda,t3_ambm9i,The Three Seals in The Wind Waker...a series of questions.,"Okay so i just posted a topic about the differences between Hyrule Historia and in-game content, when talking about my confusion about ALBW's Triforce seal. But once again I found two more differences between Hyrule Historia and in-game content that are confusing me.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright so in the Wind Waker, there are a total of 3 seals hinted at or mentioned.

1. The original seal on Ganondorf in the Dark World - **created by the Seven Sages.**
2. The Seal on Ganondorf's Demon Tribe...or his ""magic"".
3. The Seal on Ganondorf and Hyrule underwater - **created by the gods.**

We know who made the first and third seal, but was it ever stated who made the second?

We know that the Hero of Time never showed up when Ganondorf escaped the Sages seal and returned to Hyrule. **So how did the Master Sword end up in Hyrule Castle's basement, and how did it activate to seal the monsters in the castle?**

**Did it just activate by itself?**

**Did the Seven Sages have descendants, and they did it?**

**Was it King Daphnes?**

**Was it Fado and Laruto, the sages to kept the Master Sword's power intact?**

On Hyrule Historia pg126, it states that the Master Sword was the key that sealed Hyrule. But I find that incorrect, because in-game, the King of Red Lions states that the Gods' seal on Ganondorf and Hyrule was broken when Ganondorf escaped to the surface, long before WW Link pulled and broke the Master Sword seal.

Now, I've always assumed that Ganondorf broke the Gods' seal simply on himself, but Hyrule was still sealed, and that's why it remained encased underwater.

Regardless, the Gods' seal on Hyrule has nothing to do with the Master Sword seal, which simply sealed Ganon's monsters/magic.

&amp;#x200B;

**And speaking of Fado and Laruto, when exactly were they executed**? On Hyrule Historia pg124, it states that they were executed when Ganondorf escaped the underwater seal on Hyrule hundreds of years after the flood. But in-game, it states that Ganondorf killed them while he was attacking Hyrule BEFORE the flood. I assume the in-game information should be considered canon?

&amp;#x200B;

A lot to unpack here, I know lol. But again I'm running into contradictions with Hyrule Historia that are kind of messing with the story a little for me. The in-game versions clearly make more sense.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah...to simplify:

1. **Was it ever stated who made the Master Sword seal, and if not, who do you think made it?**
2. **When were Fado and Laruto executed?**

Those are my two questions.

truezelda,t3_am0mgh,The Triforce is not omnipotent. Wishes it grants are not always fully granted.,"Many people have made the argument that there's no possible way Hyrule could have come back after Wind Waker, because the King specifically worded his wish for Hyrule to be annihilated, with the assumption being that because he said that, it is guaranteed to fully come true and can never be overturned.  Putting aside all arguments about how it would be thematically inappropriate for Hyrule to come back after WW, or any potential BotW timeline arguments, I'm simply here to assert that this one particular argument is wrong.  I don't feel strongly about BotW's timeline placement, and that's not really what this post is about.  What it _is_ about is the fact this argument is demonstrably false, and I can prove it with direct dialogue from the Essence of the Triforce itself.  It doesn't get more straight from the horse's mouth than that.

At the end of A Link to the Past, when Link approaches the Triforce, this is the dialogue you get.

&gt;Welcome, Link...   I am the Essence Of The Triforce.

&gt;... ... ...

&gt;The Triforce will grant the wishes in the heart and mind of the person who touches it.

&gt;If a person with a good heart touches it, it will make his good wishes come true... If an evil-hearted person touches it, it grants his evil wishes.

&gt;The stronger the wish, the more powerful the Triforce's expression of that wish.

&gt;**Ganon's wish was to conquer the world. That wish changed the Golden Land to the Dark World.**

&gt;**Ganon was building up his power here so he could conquer the Light World and make his wish come completely true.**

&gt;But now, you have totally destroyed Ganon. His Dark World will vanish.

So there we have it.  This is the Essence of the Triforce talking, which means it is a 100% reliable authority on exactly what Ganondorf's wish was.  Ganondorf wished upon the Triforce to conquer the world.  The Triforce _failed_ to grant that wish.  It specifically said that his wish was not yet completely true.  I want to emphasize that Link has _not_ touched the Triforce or made a wish upon it yet at this point, as you can see from the rest of the dialogue:

&gt;The Triforce is waiting for a new owner. Its Golden Power is in your hands...

&gt;Now, touch it with a wish in your heart. ... ... ... ... 

In other words, this was not ""one Triforce wish counteracting another"".  Link did not wish for Ganon's death.  He had already ""totally destroyed"" Ganon before even making his wish.  He prevented the wish from fully coming true entirely through his own power.

If you're not convinced, we can examine the original Japanese's more literal translation by KWhazit, as found [here](http://www.zeldalegends.net/files/text/z3translation/z3_game_quotes.html).

&gt;Welcome, Link... I am the spirit of the Triforce.

&gt;The Triforce is the ""Golden Power"" the gods gave that grants the wish in the heart of the one who touches it.

&gt;If a righteous-hearted person touches it, a righteous wish... If an evil person touches it, an evil wish...

&gt;The stronger that person's wish is, the more the Triforce will demonstrate that power.

&gt;Ganon's wish was to claim the world. That evil wish changed the sacred land into the World of Darkness.

&gt;Once he had stored up power there, Ganon intended come out into the World of Light in order to fulfill his wish.

&gt;However, now that Ganon, who touched the Triforce, has fallen, the World of Darkness shall disappear as well.

&gt;The Triforce is waiting for a new owner. The ""Golden Power"" is in your hands.

&gt;Now, please try touching it, with a wish in your heart.

The only significant difference here is that it simply says Ganon has ""fallen"", not that he was ""completely destroyed"" like in the NoA translation, which leaves room for later Zelda games to happen.  Other than that, it pretty much says the same thing.  Ganon's wish was to conquer Hyrule.  The Triforce ""granted"" that wish by transforming the sacred realm into the dark world, and allowing him to store up power.  If the Triforce were as omnipotent as so many people insist it is, he would have simply made the wish and immediately been granted control over the world.

One argument people might be thinking of is that when Ganondorf wished to conquer ""the world"", the Triforce interpreted that as just meaning the world that he was currently _in_, that being the Sacred Realm.  However, this is impossible, because the Triforce specifically says that his wish was not fully true, and that he intended to go and fully carry out his wish.

Now, some people might be thinking ""well, it _was_ going to grant his wish, it just wasn't instant.  It could be that his wish was simply cancelled because Link killed him before it could be granted.""  However, if we're saying that wishes get cancelled when the wisher dies, then the King at the end of WW's wish would have been cancelled as well, because he's implied to have died in the flood.  So that's out too.

The most reasonable explanation is simply that the Triforce grants wishes in slightly roundabout ways, and doesn't grant wishes directly, irreversibly or instantaneously.  For Ganon, it granted his wish by granting him the power to fulfill the wish himself, and then said ""alright champ, you're on your own now"".  For the King, it granted his wish by removing the barrier protecting Hyrule from the flood, and letting the pressure of the water that would naturally bury Hyrule do its thing.

I'm not saying it's very likely that Hyrule would come back from being flooded.  After all, erosion, and time would leave hardly anything remaining at the ocean floor.  I'm simply saying you can't use the fact that ""it was a Triforce wish"" as an argument to say that it's impossible, since we have an example of a wish going unfulfilled.

This entire post is meant solely to contradict that one argument which I've heard many times.",66,public,,0

How does this compare to previous Zelda games?

Looking at this [wiki page for Zelda sales figures](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda), and this [news article](http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/04/zelda_breath_of_the_wild_is_the_best-selling_zelda_game_of_all_time_kind_of) from April 2018:

* The combined number for OoT and OoT3D is 13.22 million. 

* ALTTP released on SNES, GBA, and the SNES Mini Classic combined is 12.71 million. 

* TP on GC/Wii, and TPHD combined is 10.08 million. 

* LoZ (NES, GBA, NES Classic Mini) is 9.03 mill.

* AoL (NES, GBA, NES Classic Mini) is 6.82 mill. 

* WW + WWHD is 6.71 mill.

* MM + MM3D is 6.36 mill.

* LA + LADX is 6.05 mill.

* PH is 4.76 mill.

* OoA + OoS is 3.99 mill.

* ALBW is 3.71 mill.

* SS is 3.67 mill.

* ST is 2.96 mill.

* FS + Anniversary Edition is 2.82 mill.

* MC is 1.76 mill.

* TFH is 1.23 mill.

* FSA is 0.81 mill.

This doesn't include Virtual Console sales.

Still, considering that BotW hasn't been out for a full two years yet, it's all but guaranteed to pass OoT/OoT3D sales very soon, if it hasn't already. Its success dwarfs many of the previous games. Especially when you consider that most of the other high sellers include remasters, meaning that many of those sales may have been by customers who bought the previous version. ",90,public,,0
truezelda,t3_almywy,Was the Triforce Hidden in the Sacred Realm BEFORE or AFTER Hyrule Was Founded?,"In both Hyrule Historia and Hyrule Encyclopedia, it says that vicious battles took place over the Triforce, and that Rauru hid the Triforce in the Sacred Realm BEFORE Hyrule Kingdom and its Royal Family were established.

However in ALBW's prologue, it says that to end the legendary war, the Royal Family ordered the Sages to hide the Triforce in the Sacred Realm. But this takes place AFTER Hyrule Kingdom was established.

&amp;#x200B;

ALBW's prologue was released after Hyrule Historia, and is actual in-game content, so it may be more accurate. However, ALBW's prologue IS a legend, and may simply be detailing a corrupted history.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is the true order of these events?:

\-Establishment of Hyrule Kingdom and the Royal Family.

\-War for the Triforce

\-Banishment of the Twili Ancestors

\-Triforce hidden in the Sacred Realm and Temple of Time built

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think the order I listed is the best order. Hyrule Kingdom being established while the Triforce remained in the possession of the Hylians seems sound, especially because the Triforce is essentially the symbol of the kingdom. The Triforce being hidden BEFORE the kingdom's founding changes this, meaning the kingdom was established without the Triforce.

Looking through older threads, I found [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/8gpjs1/some_pages_from_the_zelda_encyclopedia/). Even if it was 8 months ago, I found the discussions interesting. From the pages, it states:

&gt;""...the combination of the Skull Kid‚Äôs burdened heart and the evil magic within Majora‚Äôs Mask transforms the world into the land of Termina. Termina is a parallel world with its own distinct culture, which is perhaps influenced by Majora‚Äôs ancient tribe.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The four giants were spirit friends of the Skill Kid who, much like Termina itself, were created in a new form by the power of Majora‚Äôs Mask.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""While the hero‚Äôs pure heart allows the world of Termina to momentarily revel in its salvation, as soon as he departs, that world ceases to exist.""

I'm assuming this means the game takes place in a **parallel world** (like in the original manual for the game), and then with Majora's Mask, **the parallel world transforms into Termina,** which is the world of Skull Kid's mind (and possibly Link's). I guess ""Termina"" is erased when Link leaves, and the parallel world goes back to its original state? 

Some things were from the original world, like Majora's Mask, and Skull Kid created the giants in a ""new form"", meaning the original state of the parallel world also had four guardian spirits. Maybe the backstory with Skull Kid and the Giants was actually the Skull Kid and four other spirits, but because it's his dream world, the people of Termina ""remember"" the spirits as Giants. If Termina was a parallel world, could the four spirits parallel the four Light Spirits from TP?

**TL;DR From what I'm getting, Zelda Encyclopedia (messily) reasons that there was a parallel world, and that ""Termina"" is Skull Kid's (and Link's?) dream world, and that it goes back to a parallel world when Link leaves.** 

I know Zelda Encyclopedia isn't the most canon, but if that's the most official explanation we have, I want to make sure I'm understanding it properly. ",18,public,,0

Who posed such a threat to Hyrule to the point they build a massive military base on the shore? We know that pirates exist from WW but only because the land was flooded, there were bound to be sea pirates. 

Was Hyrule ever invaded by a different land other than through divine means? Not other lands such as twilight realm. But a humanoid on the same planet different continent across the sea. 

Was Hyrule preparing for a war other than the Calamity? Was there an entire land of other Zelda creatures and monsters that aren‚Äôt associated with Ganon?

truezelda,t3_akcg1y,Pre-BOTW Link theory-crafting.,"So from every cutscene and journal entry in BOTW regarding Link, he is described as stoic, quiet, and completely devoted to his role in the kingdom. Mipha seems to believe something happened to him to make him this way, and Zelda seems to believe it is due to his burden of wielding the master sword and protecting her.

There are two things that are very strange to me about this incarnation of Link.

The first is the Master Sword, as we have zero idea of how he obtained it. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be the typical lock or seal on the sword, and perhaps Link simply strolled into the Great Hyrule Forest and grabbed it, but I like to believe there was something more. 

The other strange thing to me is Link‚Äôs demeanor pre-Ganon and during BOTW.
Link is completely silent in all memories. Now cut to link‚Äôs awakening in the shrine of resurrection (Get it) and he seems to have a very different demeanor.

Link DOES speak in BOTW. The dialogue choices are his speech, and none quite match up with the stoic persona he had going for him previously. There is plenty of humor, sarcasm, witty puns, and general sass.

You could chock this up to Link not having to protect Zelda and uphold the image of the wieldee of the master sword, but I believe Link‚Äôs role is even greater at this point than ever. He is literally the one person who can save Hyrule, and free Zelda from her century long clash with Ganon. So why isn‚Äôt he stoic and silent now as well? 

We know Link lost his memories after his 100 year slumber, and was able to recover bits and pieces of his journey with Zelda through our in game travels.

This brings me to my main theory that something bad or traumatic happened to Link before BOTW, and changes him into the silent knight we are shown. Links change in personality could be explained perfectly with this as the traumatic memory would have been forgotten like everything else.

Perhaps this traumatic memory has something do to with Link gaining the Master sword. I have no idea what this could be but this is just a thought I‚Äôve had after replaying the game.

Maybe there could be a prequel to the game following Links obtaining of the Master Sword? I definitely doubt it as it‚Äôs super unlikely and I‚Äôm not sure how they could distance it from the thematics of BOTW, but I do have one idea.

Maybe the pre-BOTW game follows Links journey through a Majora‚Äôs Mask/Links Awakening style story with a parallel universe or something similar. Whatever it is, I believe it would take place mostly away from Hyrule (Minus obtaining the Master Sword) and would have to be pretty traumatic a la Majora‚Äôs Mask. Perhaps Link, aspiring to obtain the master sword is lost in the Lost Woods and end up in another realm/world.

truezelda,t3_ak8scb,The Ancient Children of the Forest,"*Part One: [King in the Mountain](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/agx4nw/king_in_the_mountain/)*

Take a look at [the symbol](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14/Walkthrough/02/0243.jpg) on this door. Is it a bird? Is it a leaf? Or is it both?

The door is the entrance to the Skyview Temple. The Bird Statue location on the map is called the Forest Temple. So, is it the Skyview Temple, or the Forest Temple? Or is it actually both?

The link between the Sky and the Forest reminds us of a similar connection in previous Zelda games. Forest and Wind have been connected in at least two games. In OoT, the Forest Temple, and the Forest Element, were originally going to be the Wind Temple and Element. Then, in TWW, the Korok Makar and his ancestor, the Kokiri Fado, are the Sages of Wind, despite being children of the Forest.

So, it isn't surprising to see a similar connection in SS between the Forest and the Sky. But, can the Skyview Temple, and the Faron Woods in general, tell us more about the ancient people who lived during the Era of the Goddess Hylia?

**The Children of the Forest**

Who would you call the Children of the Forest in SS?

Most people would agree with you, if you said it's the Kikwis. This race of creatures live in Faron Woods, and it's hard to classify them as either plants or animals. They definitely seem to be occupying the role previously held by the Kokiri, and the Koroks.

However, as you explore Faron Woods, you start to find the ruins of structures that were built long ago, during the Era of the Goddess Hylia. [Here's an example of one of them](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/8098361.jpg?1490641397). Notice how the architecture is shaped into leaves? There's the large single leaves capping each pillar, and the three-leaf symbol in the centre of the arch. These can be found throughout the Faron Woods region, and Skyview Temple.

Who built these structures? It must have been a civilization with a strong connection to the Forest, as indicated by the prominent use of the leaf symbols. 

Could it have been the Kikwis?

Remember in my previous post where we discussed who built the Fire Sanctuary? The architecture of the Fire Sanctuary made it unlikely that the Mogmas, or the Gorons, built it by themselves. Some other party must have helped them.

The same must be true for all the structures found in the Faron Woods region. It seems highly unlikely that the Kikwis built these structures, or at least not on their own. 

Thankfully, the game strongly hints at who built these structures in Faron Woods:

&gt;**Oooh, look at that! A real live human! Haven't seen one of you in a while**, kwrrrrrk.

&gt;They used to call me Yerbal. Now I'm just the old Kikwi hermit. I watch over this forest here...when I'm not nappin'.

&gt;I don't know how you wandered all the way up here, but let me ask you something... Can you really see me?

&gt;- Yerbal, Kikwi Hermit

Yerbal, the Kikwi hermit who lives at the top of the Great Tree, is the only one of his race to recognize Link as a human. He knows this because he has seen humans before. That means Yerbal is very old, going back all the way to the Era of the Goddess Hylia, when humans still lived on the Surface. 

(Interestingly, he is surprised that Link can see him, and he mentions this again several times later on in the conversation. This highlights a similarity between him and the Koroks, which usually can't be seen by normal people. It's hard to know if this applies to all Kikwi, since later in the game, one of them is taken to Skyloft and can be seen by people other than Link and Zelda.)

But, there's an even more important quote tying humans to the Forest:

&gt;**A great many ancient songs praise the way humans once lived in these woods. They were in harmony with nature**.

&gt;Honestly, I think those songs fail to see the big picture. **Don't you agree these woods are far more beautiful now that the humans are gone?**

&gt;- Faron, Water Dragon 

Humans lived in Faron Woods, and they lived in harmony with nature. That explains the structures found there with all the plant symbolism. *The leaf symbols represented the humans who lived in Faron Woods*. They were completely at home in the forest. At least for a time...

**Heavenly Ambition**

Remember in the previous post that birds were a symbol connected to Hylia? Well, now we can explore the fascinating interplay between the leaf and bird symbols found in the Skyview Temple, and what hints they may give us about the ancient humans.

[This is the front of the temple](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/871877.png?1490641410). Notice all the leaf symbolism. It really does look like a Forest Temple. But, as soon as we approach the front door, we get our first glimpse of the connection between the two types of symbols, as mentioned at the beginning of this post. Is it a leaf, a bird, or is it both?

The first part of the interior of the temple is full of plant symbolism - leaves, flowers, roots, etc. Probably the most shocking is the [symbol on the wall](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/3769929.png?1502656151) facing Link, as soon as he enters the temple. More on that later on.

Next, Link enters the [main chamber of the temple](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/7618436_orig.png). While bird symbols can be found in the previous rooms, here is where it smacks us in the face. Note the large bird statues, with their heads looking skyward, surrounding the large structure in the centre. This structure, where the Beetle is kept, is shaped like a bird with outstretched wings, its beak pointed towards the opening in the ceiling. Towards the sky. Sunlight pours into the room from this opening, a shock after the gloominess of the previous rooms.

Symbols of plants and birds continue throughout the rest of the temple. In the final chamber before the Spring, where you fight Ghirahim, all these elements can be found together. On the floor of the room is the [symbol of a golden sun](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/6068150_orig.png).

What can all of this teach us about the ancient humans?

First of all, what do we know of the temple's function?

&gt;This is Skyview Temple, a structure constructed in ancient times. You can expect to encounter many mechanisms **designed to keep intruders at bay**.

&gt;- Fi

So, one of its primary functions was to keep intruders away. Away from what? The most inner part of the temple, the Skyview Spring. It's a sacred place important to the Goddess Hylia. These humans of the forest were connected to her. But, the construction of the temple still tells us something else about the builders. 

The name of the temple in Japanese is Â§©Êúõ„ÅÆÁ•ûÊÆø. Let's break that down. Á•ûÊÆø means ""temple"", and „ÅÆ means ""of"". The interesting part is Â§©Êúõ. There's no word that can be directly translated from that. However, by splitting up the two kanji, and getting their individual meanings, we can work out what it means together. 

Â§© translates as ""heavens, sky, imperial"". So, it can mean the literal sky, or even the heavenly realm of gods. There's also a specific meaning in Buddhism to a heaven-like realm visited as a stage of death and rebirth. Buddhist mythology and concepts play a major role in SS, as will be shown in a future post. Êúõ translates as ""ambition, full moon, hope, desire, aspire to, expect"". The Zelda Wiki gives Â§©Êúõ a literal translation of ""Sky-Gazing"". But, looking at the individual definitions helps us to understand what this temple represented to the ancient humans of the forest.

**When the Children of the Forest met the Goddess**

Here's what I think all of this tells us about the ancient humans of the forest. I believe that after the creation of the world by the Golden Goddesses, the first humans lived in the ancient forest. These humans lived in harmony with nature, and the forest. As their culture progressed, this reverence for nature was reflected in their architecture, as shown by all the plant symbolism. They were happy to live in the forest and be a part of its natural cycles. To be one with the forest. 

As the humans further explored their surroundings, they had an encounter that forever altered their culture. They encountered the Goddess Hylia. She had made her home, where the Temple of Hylia stands, at one end of the Faron Woods region. 

Before this encounter, the humans had worshipped the forest and its spirits. The HH tells us that, ""the Great Tree stands in the center of a vast forest, and a variety of living things come here to ask for its blessing."" This is similar to what the dragon Eldin tells us of his region. ""There was a time when those above-ground and those below lived together in harmony by the blessing of the great mountain.""

As the humans learned from Hylia's wisdom, they came to worship her. She was the great guardian deity of all the world, the protector of the Absolute Power - the Triforce. 

Hylia is linked to the Earth and Sky/Heaven. Her connection to Earth reflects that she was also created by the Golden Goddesses, and therefore part of the world. Her duty is to protect it. But, she is also connected to the Sky, or Heaven. She is a goddess. A powerful one who can see the future. 

By coming to worship the Goddess Hylia, the focus of the ancient humans changed. By her connection to Earth, they still had great respect for the forest which had been their home. But, the Goddess had opened their eyes, and turned their gaze towards the heavens. They had loftier ambitions now. 

When the Goddess instructed them to protect the sacred Spring, the temple they constructed reflected the change happening within them. The Leaf, while still important, was morphing into the Bird.

The Bird is the symbol the humans will take with them as they spread into the rest of the world.

**Charting our course from here**

Next time, we go back to Eldin Volcano, to see how the ancient humans progress, and we'll eventually learn more about the king mentioned there.

As you may be starting to realize, this will actually be a series of posts exploring the ancient world of SS, and the humans who lived back then. It will involve going back and forth between the different regions, as I chart, what I believe to be the course of human civilization back then. None of this can ever be confirmed, so it will remain as speculation. But, I hope to bring out interesting points for you to consider, both from what can be gleaned in-game, and from real world mythologies. 

For instance, the [symbol of the Eye](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/3769929.png?1502656151) found at the beginning of the Skyview Temple can lead to some interesting questions. Is it an eye, or is it a flower like the rest of the plant symbolism?

If we see the birth of the Bird from the Leaf, in the door to the temple, I believe we see a similar birth here. The birth of what will become the Sheikah Eye symbol. 

Impa tells us:

&gt;This is the nature of the task given to **my tribe**.

&gt;As a member of the Sheikah, **the goddess's chosen guardians**, I gladly welcome this duty.

The Sheikah were chosen by Hylia to be her guardians. They are their own tribe, but the symbol in the temple might point to the beginning of that tribe. Perhaps they were humans who were specifically chosen by Hylia to be her guardians. If so, they were originally members of the ancient humans of the forest. We will see, what seems to be, an advanced version of the Eye symbol later on.

truezelda,t3_akajda,Curious case of the Zelda Timeline 2: an alternative theory on the whole affair,"Hello my dear friends, today I am going to impart on you knowledge handed down by those who have sold out their souls from the Zelda community, the sellouts‚Ñ¢ and truthers‚Ñ¢, and have turned on the Historia and the Encyclopedia to force their views on the canon down your throat. This is a follow-up to [this thread from two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/aev2jb/the_curious_case_of_the_history_of_the_zelda/), detailing our view on the Zelda timeline. All kidding aside, this will lay out my views on the timeline (in chronological order), the Extended Child Timeline, and how that fits together. There have been previous threads about it in the past but those were not very representative or did not explain everything very well I feel, hence this thread. Books and interviews are not taken into account and I have no desire to discuss what is and what isn't canon here, as that already took place in the previous thread. Lastly, this arrived a bit later than expected because the last two weeks were packed with exams, papers and other schoolwork, which is always fun, ugh.

First parts do not differ that much from the Historia; the world and the Triforce are created by the Golden Gods. The Triforce is guarded by Hylia, a light god created by the three Golden Gods, until Demise appears. The Ancient Battle happens, the Goddess's Sword is created so she can combat Demise, and eventually, Demise is sealed. Thousands of years later Hylia is incarnated as the first Zelda and  Skyward Sword happens. Demise is killed, although he speaks out the Curse of the Demon Tribe. That curse causes the Demon Tribe to appear time and again, along with an incarnation of Demise's own hatred who will chase those with the spirit of the hero and the blood of the goddess. The Master Sword is also tempered from the Goddess's Sword and the Triforce is in the hands of Link and Zelda, remaining on the surface at the top of the great Hylia Statue.

&gt; It is the legend of the Triforce, once kept within Hyrule itself. -LBW intro

&gt; The royal family summoned the seven sages, who sealed the Triforce in the Sacred Realm. -LBW intro

&gt; To end the war for the Triforce, the royal family decided to hide it in the Sacred Realm. They summoned the Seven Sages of legend, who used their power to seal the Triforce away. -painting no. 2 in Hyrule Castle

It seems the act of sealing the Triforce, which would be the creation of Ocarina of Time's temple of time, stopped the wars for the time being:

&gt; If someone with an evil mind has his wish granted, the world will be consumed by evil...That is what has been told.... So, the ancient Sages built the Temple of Time to protect the Triforce from evil ones. -OoT Zelda

At this time a two-man rule style lock was put in place; the three spiritual stones were given to the Deku Tree, the Gorons and the Zoras and the royal family kept the Ocarina of Time and the Song of Time. This seems a sort of peace treaty and not any one party can unlock the Triforce seal, only one who is trusted by all parties. This would happen a long time before Ocarina, long enough for the creation of the Temple of Time to be considered legend and enough time for the different stones and the ocarina to become heirlooms that are ""passed down"" in Zelda's words. The Unification War would happen sometime after and what it is about is unknown, but it probably involves the Gerudo who were for some reason not included in the peace treaty and didn't get a Sacred Realm key. That war is eventually quelled, ending with the sitting king of Hyrule unifying the land.

A decade after the end of the Unification War, Ocarina of Time occurs and Ganondorf I appears. He becomes the second Demon King during the course of the game after claiming the Triforce of Power. He rules over Hyrule for seven years, but is defeated by Link and sealed away by the second generation of the Seven Sages (Zelda, Rauru, Saria, Darunia, Impa, Ruto and Nabooru). The first generation, the Ancient Sages who sealed the Triforce in ancient times, were presumably killed off by Ganondorf when he obtained the Triforce, only Rauru surviving the onslaught. Nonetheless, Zelda sends Link back in time so that he can relive his childhood; Link then closes the road between times by putting the Master Sword back in its pedestal and so time is split in two, the well-known Adult Timeline/Child Timeline split. It is namely said by Sheik that the Master Sword functions as a sort or ship that sails up and down the river of time, with the temple acting as a port. Time would not be split while Link is travelling; only when Link dams the river in the ending by returning the Master Sword and closing the Door of Time.

In the Adult Timeline, the shortest of the two, the legend of the Hero of Time is commonly passed down. The people believe he is a time-travelling hero who will always appear when evil rises, but this is not true and  comes to bite them in the ass when Ganondorf managed to circumvent his seal. A hero did not appear and the Knights of Hyrule could not best Ganondorf's stronghold, so the fate of the kingdom was left up to the gods. They decided to flood the land, with a few chosen ones being able to escape to the mountaintops. New societies are established on the Great Sea and this remains so for centuries, until The Wind Waker. Ganondorf returns, but is also killed off for good and with him the old Hyrule; the Triforce is at last reunified, but Ganondorf's chance to make his wish is taken from him and afterwards the Triforce returns to the Sacred Realm, never to be disturbed again as of writing. The Master Sword, having fulfilled its purpose in slaying the Demon King, is also forever lost beneath the waves. Link and Tetra also set out to find new land, per the wishes of the ancient king Daphnes, at the end of the game. During that journey Phantom Hourglass happened and they eventually establish a new Hyrule. That land was once of the Spirits of Good (Light Gods in Japanese) and housed a seal on the Demon King Malladus. 100 years after the founding of Hyrule, that evil is released but also subdued by Link and Zelda. The land if left in their care by the Lokomos.

Commonly in the ECT, Tri Force Heroes is placed ages after Spirit Tracks (think a BotW-sized gap). It really does not connect to anything else, but the mythology around the Triforce is muddled up. Instead of the virtues of power, wisdom and courage, the three attributes attributed to heroes are side-parted hair, side-buns and pointed ears... which would be in line with the corrupting of knowledge in the Adult Timeline due to the Old Hyrule being washed away (Example: The ""Triumph Forks""). That, and photography is rather big in Hytopia (which would be a distant future version of the new Hyrule that has enjoyed peace for ages, hence the decadence), as kind of in the Adult Timeline (Examples: Lenzo, Ferrus, etc). For the most part, photography doesn't really exist in the main reality of the CT, only being present in alternate realities, outside of an minor exception in TP and the far future BotW. I do not have very strong opinions on TFH's timeline placement in general, but there it is.

That ends the Adult Timeline and so we jump over to the Child Timeline, wherein Link still has the Triforce of Courage, per the ending of Ocarina of Time. Link has effectively undone the events of Ocarina of Time, with the chronology continuing from the same time in the game as when Link first went to Hyrule Castle, prior to getting Zelda's Letter but likely after the Deku Tree ordeal. Him having the Triforce of Courage still may have been the cause of a relatively unknown Triforce split, with the other pieces going to Ganondorf and the royal family. Speaking of Ganondorf I, Link tells the royal family what he is planning and so the Gerudo King is forced to invade with the Gerudo. Link goes off to search for Navi and Majora's Mask happens, while the legend about his efforts and his ordeals in a horrifying future he ensured never came to pass are passed down by the royal family:

&gt; In Hyrule, a legend is handed down by the royal family in which a lone boy appears. After saving Hyrule by battling a great evil, he disappeared from legend.

It seems this legend is present somewhat in Twilight Princess too, with mentions of an ancient hero who wore the clothes Twilight Princess Link wears in his game, wielded the Hero's Bow and saved Hyrule from a great crisis once:

&gt; These clothes are said to have been worn by the legendary hero who saved Hyrule from a crisis long ago.

It seems that, in tandem with their own history, these legends of the Hero of Time are passed down as well (and technically the adult era is part of the history of the Child Timeline; without the events of the adult era happening and causing Link to bring a warning from the future, the CT would not occur). But anyways: Ganondorf I's invasion ends in failure and he is slated to be executed. That fails because he has the Triforce of Power and he is sealed in the Twilight Realm. Ages later, he returns with Zant to take over Hyrule and Twilight Princess occurs. At the end of this game, Ganondorf I is of course killed, but he speaks some rather interesting lines:

&gt; Do not think everything ends with this... Think of this as the beginning of a bloodsmeared history of light and darkness!

This seems rather similar to what Demise says after he is killed, a warning of things to come. At the same time, the Triforce of Power also leaves him for unclear reasons. The Triforce pieces seem to return to the Sacred Realm at this point, after which the Master Sword is also returned to the ruins of the Temple of Time, as seen in the ending.

In the ECT, Minish Cap is placed many years after Twilight Princess. It is placed here because there would be little place for it to take place before Ocarina of Time, in the era where there were constant and prolonged wars. Placing it even further back, in the time before the wars happened, would be rather difficult too as the Triforce was still kept in Hyrule in that time and we do not see the Triforce itself anywhere in Minish Cap (outside of iconography, but that is not the actual Triforce of course). Another thing is that, in Ocarina of Time, it is said Malon's mother composed Epona's Song (""My mother composed this song. Isn't it nice?  Let's sing together.""), while the Malon in Minish Cap can be heard singing part of it.

Several factors in Twilight Princess also play a part in this placement. The location of the Sacred Realm in the present is not entirely clear (in the past it was in the Temple of Time, but is not anymore) and Link only returns the Master Sword to the Temple of Time after it is explored by the group of Auru. Both of these may indicate these locations are slowly becoming lost; the location of the Sacred Realm is unclear and the Master Sword is missing from the temple at the time it is explored by others, while no regular people seem to notice that Link has the sword during the game itself (Hena even photoshops it out in the photos she takes if you catch fish at the fishing hole...). Another thing is that at the end of the game, king Bulblin defects from the side of Ganondorf and Zant. In the credits he is shown wandering about Hyrule with his own party, which realistically can lead into the War of the Bound Chest mentioned in Minish Cap. A clan of rogue demons attacks, without a leader ever being specified, and may be a continuation of those who defected from Ganondorf in TP (this also helps to later on segue into the existence of the Moblin King in OoX and the turncoat Moblins in the original LoZ, as it shows the monster races are becoming more and more independent of external leaders). On the other hand, the violent demons could quite easily be remnants of Ganondorf's own forces wreaking havoc after his death; the exact same scenario we see play out in Zelda II. The Minish, meanwhile, create gifts styled after the Master Sword and the Triforce (the Picori Blade and the Light Force) since both of them have become lost since then.

What follows is the rest of the Four Swords trilogy: the backstory of Four Swords, Four Swords itself and Four Swords Adventures. Important to note here is that Vaati comes to be considered the scourge of Hyrule in this time, so much so that all the blame for the events in FSA are solely placed on him, even by those who worship the King of Darkness (the various mages) at first. The Four Sword, reforged from the Picori Blade in The Minish Cap, also degrades with time: in Four Swords the user does not have full control over his copies anymore and Vaati managed to break out of the seal placed on him all by himself. In Four Swords Adventures, it is so bad that the sword needs to be constantly recharged with Force Gems to even obtain the power to repel evil. Lastly, Four Swords Adventures is posited as a direct sequel to Four Swords here. The time between the games was considered peaceful according to the intro of Four Swords Adventures and Link and Zelda are also directly named, implying these are the same people we meet in-game:

&gt; Princess Zelda's childhood friend, the boy Link, borrowed the mysterious power of the Four Sword, and at the end of a furious battle, he succeeded in sealing Gufuu [Vaati] away once again. And so, peace was restored to Hyrule once again, or so everyone thought. However... -FSA intro after which the events of FSA start

The next thing that comes here is the connection with A Link to the Past. Now, I am not saying that Four Swords Adventures is the Imprisoning War; the Triforce is not a major plot element of FSA and neither is the Sacred Realm. The war is not something that is ever shown in-game, but rather, FSA would act as a prelude to the war, which we can conclude through evidence-based inference. It will be mainly going of off the LTTP Super Famicom manual. FSA features a reincarnated Ganondorf (II), who becomes the King of Darkness Ganon by claiming the Dark Trident. Now, at the end of FSA, Ganon II is sealed in the Four Sword and that is seemingly the end of that. However, there are two things that need to be considered here. 1: Vaati broke out all of his own in FS and is weaker than Ganon. 2: the sword itself is in a much weaker state than FS. It seems clear from these things that it is an inevitability Ganon would eventually break out of the sword. Ganon also had religious followers in FSA, including Deku Scrubs who worshipped him, Mages and a group of thieves who made Kakariko Village unsafe. This last group seems likely to have formed the thief gang mentioned in LTTP's manual, and one of them even says:

&gt; Leave the village and follow a mighty river downstream, and you'll find a temple. You should go there and swear your allegiance to the great king.

So what would happen after he breaks free and gathers these thieves is that he builds up a reputation as a notorious thief. Commonly he becomes known as Ganon, although his given name is still Ganondorf. Both names are used for him in FSA to some degree, mostly because no-one had a clue who Ganon even was. Instead, the blame was pinned on Vaati because he had terrorized the land so often in Minish Cap, the FS backstory and FS itself. Up until now, Vaati has been the only true scourge of Hyrule; Ganondorf I was simply someone who tried and (thanks mainly to the Hero of Time) failed to invade Hyrule, more akin to an ancient warlord than a true Demon King. Even Zelda does not know who Ganon is in the finale. Even Zelda does not know who Ganon is in the finale until he screams his name at her:

&gt; Zelda: !! This mighty mass of darkness, what on earth is that?! I..is that? Gufuu [Vaati]?! No, it's different from the wind majin [devil/demon]? But in this case? If I don't seal it away with my power?! My breath is heavy? My power is fading? already from that? The air around me seems to be dying? Just a little bit? ?more power?! More?!!

&gt; Ganon: Enough?! The questionable power of the princess of Hyrule, too, amounts to only that. Zelda! I, Ganon, now seal you away!

Now, Ganon would likely go back to Hyrule Castle at some point to reclaim the Dark Mirror he used in FSA, since Zelda retook it in that game. The castle contains many secrets, one of which is a conspicuous chamber Zelda enters in the post-credits scene of FSA: one with a Triforce symbol above it. This is very likely the entrance of the Sacred Realm where the Triforce rests, considering the symbol above it, which glows when Zelda enters (note that FSA has a surprising lack of Triforce symbolism, with this conspicuous glowing symbol being one of  the only instances in the game), and that the primary entrance to the Sacred Realm/Dark World in A Link to the Past is stated (""I'm afraid it seems that when the priest dissolved the seal, he opened a passage at the castle's entrance that links the Dark World to this side."") and shown to be at the castle as well. Ganon and his thieves would sneak in and accidentally stumble upon the entrance to the Sacred Realm, as per the manual story, with the proceeding events playing out exactly as described in the manual. They fight it out amongst themselves and Ganon emerges victorious. He claims the Triforce, therefore transforming from the King of Darkness (a title he had obtained by claiming the Trident in FSA) to the Demon King. In the Japanese version, he namely has a combined title: Demon King of Darkness, which is exactly the same between FSA and ALttP sans a single kanji missing in FSA (the one for ""demon""). This particular rendition of the title as seen in FSA/ALttP is not used or approximated in any other game.

One last thing remains though: doesn't A Link to the Past say that he was a human while he claimed the Triforce? If we look at the Japanese manual of LTTP, we see that this term is used: ""Áî∑"". This apparently [does not indicate ""human"" per say, but more commonly refers to one of the male gender](https://jisho.org/search/%E7%94%B7). The same character is used to refer to Ganon, specifically the trident-wielding beast, in FSA:

&gt;Êàë„ÄÖ„Éè„Ç§„É©„É´È®éÂ£´Âõ£„ÅØ„ÄÅÂº∑Â§ß„Å™Ê≠¶Âô®„ÇíÊåÅ„Å£„ÅüÁî∑„Å´ÂÄí„Åï„Çå„ÄÅÂÆùÁéâ„Å®„Å®„ÇÇ„Å´ È≠îÁïå„Å∏„Å®ËêΩ„Å®„Åï„Çå„Åü„ÄÇ „Åù„ÅÆÂæå„Åô„Åê Èªí„ÅçÂΩ±ÈÅî„Å´„Çà„Çä„ÄÅÊàë„ÄÖ„Å®ÂÆùÁéâ„ÅØ ÂêÑÂú∞„Å´Êï£„Çâ„Åï„Çå

&gt;We, the group of Hyrule Knights, were felled by a man with a mighty weapon, and were dropped into the Makai [demon world] along with the jewels. Right after that, among the black shadows, we and the jewels were scattered all over the place.

The idea is that Ganon was already a demon beast when he entered the Sacred Realm and obtained the title of Demon King after claiming the full Triforce, which he got at once because he had a balanced heart (a balance of power, courage and wisdom does not necessarily imply that one is a good person; in fact, in the ALttP manual itself, it says one must be worthy to inherit the Triforce and says those worthy are not limited to good persons). In later appearances, Ganon's outfit also changes from a royal purple to a demonic red and he obtains spikes and skulls on these clothes, symbols indicative of demons in this series:

&gt; Ornamental Skull: This simple, slightly macabre fashion statement bears the Bokoblin symbol.

In the ECT, basically what is the Downfall Timeline in the Historia occurs after this. Ganon's actions instigate the Imprisoning War and per the in-game text of ALttP, he himself does not get out of the Sacred Realm because he does not know how, having accidentally found the realm to begin with. The fact that the Triforce rests in the Sacred Realm becomes common knowledge once more, although the Master Sword is still considered lost per the manual of LTTP. After the Imprisoning War ends and the seal is cast, the sword is rediscovered by the seven sages and the Prophecy of the Great Cataclysm is inscribed on its pedestal (since said prophecy was made by the Imprisoning War Sages according to the Japanese version of LTTP), with the descendants of the sages being aware of the sword's location and the rest of Hyrule only vaguely knowing ""somewhere in the woods. Eventually, LTTP, the Oracles and Link's Awakening occur, in that order, all with the same Link. The Oracles are a ploy by Twinrova to revive Ganon, who partially succeed in that effort. This is the first time Ganon is resurrected from the dead in this timeline (instead of breaking a seal or reincarnating), which leads to a disturbance amongst the Hyruleans. It is thought that because of this, the Triforce is split in three as described in A Link Between Worlds (an event I think we see happen after the credits of the Oracles' linked ending) so that its power can be kept out of any one person's reach and Link grows restless. He goes to foreign lands to train and on the way home Link's Awakening happens.

A few generations later, A Link Between Worlds occurs and in it the Triforce is unified under the royal family, with the stuff concerning Lorule not being that important in the grand scheme of things (although Yuganon does seemingly lose his trident, the one from FSA, LTTP and the Oracles, during the final boss fight). It is also in this time that the mythological and cultural impact of Ganon is described: every child grows up hearing about his legend and fearing him according to Sahasrahla. Said legend is also a bit of a quick recap of the CT's history up till this point, only covering events actually relevant to the Triforce itself, given that ALBW's story revolves around the Triforce: the Triforce was fought over and sealed away in the ancient wars before Ocarina of Time. From then on, it rested in the Sacred Realm and remained untouched for the most part (aside from the slight hiccup in TP but even during the TP era that was pretty obscure knowledge and the Sacred Realm wasn't really breached anyway). Then Ganondorf, commonly known as Ganon, the infamous thief breaks in and claims it for himself. He then effectively has the kingdom in his grasp during LTTP via Agahnim, who is a priest of his, but is defeated by a hero who answered the call of princess Zelda. This hero obtained the Master Sword by claiming the three pendants of virtue according to Sahasrahla and saved the castle from the grip of evil. In the end, Ganon was killed and his spirit ""sealed in darkness"" (read: the underworld) by the hero, who could only reach the Demon King with the help of the sages of his day: the Seven Maidens. This was also not the first sealing of Ganon according to Sahasrahla:

&gt; He gathered the descendants of the Seven Sages, who had once sealed Ganon in darkness‚Ä¶and together they defeated the Demon King and sealed him away once more. Hyrule was saved.

This seems to refer to the events of the Imprisoning War (""Seven Sages who once sealed Ganon in darkness"") and the events of ALttP itself (""Gathered their descendants and together sealed the Demon King once more""). A set of robed figures do look out over LTTP Link and Zelda in the final painting, but those seem to be the same figures from the second painting depicting the sealing of the Triforce and not the actual sages who helped the hero, who are seemingly not depicted in any of the paintings. Three separate sets of sages are discussed in the backstory and it gets convoluted fast at any rate.

After A Link Between Worlds, the golden age from the backstory of Zelda II takes place, represented by [this painting](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/275323494261063681/418856678864453632/Golden_Era.png) from the credits. The following is fairly well-known I believe: the Triforce is used to govern the kingdom until the Triforce Courage is secreted away by the last wise king because his son is not a man of character. That leads to an age of decline, in which the NES games take place. Ganon is revived by unknown means and defeated in the original game and the Triforce is reassembled in Zelda II. Thereby Link fulfilled the prophecy of the ancient wise king and became the next great king of Hyrule himself.

What follows is Breath of the Wild and its backstory: the rulership of king Link brings a new cultural revival of Hyrule and a golden age begins. Advanced technology is developed by the Sheikah and it is used against the next time Ganon attacks as Calamity Ganon (which is likely the result of another botched resurrection, Ganon's mind and soul being revived without a physical body). His arrival is expected, since the cycle of Ganon is baked into the fabric of Hyrulean culture at this point, which was already somewhat the case by the time of A Link Between Worlds. After that, a peace of 10.000 years starts wherein Ganon is dormant, as said in the diary of Purah. I believe this is the longest gap between games in this timeline yet and leads to a bit of a generalization of the history up till that point: by BotW itself the focus is laid on the cycle that has scourged Hyrule since FSA, and in many respects since SS itself the one of the demonic beast Ganon who completely renounced his humanity to become a true Demon King, evil itself incarnated. Ganondorf I is also mentioned in the game, but only as a vague ""man of the desert"" who brought calamity to Zora's Domain; a remnant of the ancient legends passed down about the Hero of Time and the future he prevented (who is just another hero in the eyes of this Hyrule, instead of the quasi-Jesus figure he is in the Adult Timeline, likely due to how many heroes have arisen to push back the Demon King compared to only the two pre-TWW). After the peace of 10.000 years ends, Calamity Ganon returns once again and he is defeated 100 years later by the latest incarnations of Link and Zelda. That is currently where the ""legend of Zelda"", this long tale of Hylia, her chosen hero and descendants, the blade of evil's bane, the demon king, and the Triforce ends, with either the ultimate destruction of or simply the latest sealing of Ganon.

That, is, in a nutshell the Extended Child Timeline and a lot of text to take in, which is why I have made [this image to summarize it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_xHjLs9Gdr5MDZKOUlaVEJWUWs/view). I also need to say that many of the quotes above are direct translations from the Japanese versions of the games, as translated by the ZeldaLegends forums: http://forums.legendsalliance.com/topic/17108-list-of-japanese-translations/. The Japanese characters that accompany them were not included as to not clutter up the formatting too much, especially when multiple, disparate quotes are involved. Lastly, to make something clear, certain Zelda titles were made in collaboration with Capcom, namely the two Oracles, Four Swords/LTTP GBA and The Minish Cap. However, this does not devalue their contribution to the storyline; on the contrary. The man who wrote the Oracles and directed Four Swords and the Minish Cap, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, would go on to become a prominent member of the Zelda team. He also directed Phantom Hourglass, Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild. Furthermore, Four Swords Adventures was developed fully in-house by Nintendo and is not actually a Capcom game.

truezelda,t3_ajt92k,The Legend of Zelda needs more Master Quest,"What may very well be my blandest title aside, I've written yet another article on a franchise I told myself I would stop writing articles on. This time, I decided to write up my thoughts and feelings on ""Master Quest."" Not so much the Ocarina of Time variant itself- although I do discuss it quite a bit- but what Master Quest represents conceptually. 

I've always been deeply enamored with the idea that any given Zelda could feature this bizarro campaign where all the main dungeons were changed. It's something I always admired about the original's Second Quest growing up and a concept I feel deeply in love with when I got my hands on the Ocarina of Time/Master Quest GameCube compilation disc that was sent out for The Wind Waker pre-orders. 

Its grand reappearance in Ocarina of Time 3D just solidified the fact that I needed more Master Quest by any means necessary. Of course, it isn't as if the series hasn't had Master Quest analogues since. Hero Mode is a good alternative and Master Mode, while nowhere near as refined as I had hoped, did scratch that brutal difficulty itch I'd been feeling (for the first half of the game at least.)

I typically don't write such lengthy intros for my articles, but this is a topic I'm rather passionate about and I'd love to hear how everyone feels about Master Quest, Hero Mode, and Master Mode. I don't imagine we'll see more Master Quest in the future considering the circumstances surrounding its existence, but I do hope it's something we'll see at least one more time. Even if it is more beneficial to just make an all new game with new dungeons at that point.

I've given a lot of thought to this, looked at HH's wording, and here's my conclusions:

1. The Sacred Realm in the adult portion of OOT is inhabited by monsters, but it doesn't turn people into monsters like the Dark World does.

2. The Sacred Realm in the adult portion of OOT is geographically the same as it was before Ganondorf first entered. It was Ganondorf's wish on the complete Triforce that turned the Sacred Realm into a mirror of Hyrule.

3. The Temple of Light is intact in the adult portion of OOT. As Rauru explains, Ganondorf wasn't able to corrupt it. When Ganondorf got the complete Triforce and made a wish, the Temple of Light was replaced with the Pyramid where the final boss battle of ALTTP occurs.",36,public,,0

truezelda,t3_aiz3n4,"New Terminology Request, and a fandom/subreddit question","Warning: This is a bit of a Rant. I hope it's coherent by the end, and I apologize before hand. 

**Where** does one talk about the level design in the Zelda Series? **How** does one talk about level design in the Zelda series? Specifically, the level design of Dungeons and Temples that existed in the series before Breath of the Wild? 

As much as I like the characters, the combat, or the music, for me in particular, the Temple/Dungeon and puzzle design of the Zelda series has always been what cemented it as the best in my mind. The way a temple starts extremely narrow and then opens up as the player learns the brand new central dungeon puzzle mechanic of the area and slowly builds to a miniboss fight that rewards the player with an item that re-contextualizes the puzzles the player has been seeing for the previous half hour in new light, and culminates in a ""Mastery"" based puzzle that requires a player's complete knowledge of dungeon and item mechanics in order to earn the master key and fight a boss that, despite being the marquee fights of the dungeon, are basically just timing puzzles that require the player to understand, experiment, and master the dungeon item. This repeated gameplay loop *is* the definition of Zelda to me. The slow build up of introducing new mechanics, whether dungeon or item based, and testing the player until they master it with ever increasingly complex puzzles that rely on those mechanics.

The Divine Beasts... aren't dungeons. Not ""Zelda Dungeons"", at any rate, *using the definition above*. They don't feel the same way, because they have none of the core aspects that make prior dungeons in the series tick. 

**1) They don't teach you a unique dungeon Mechanic** (all the dungeon mechanics are the same, aka rotation. You learn in your first divine beast that the solution to most puzzles is just to rotate the beast in a manner that solves your current task, and then every divine beast after that you know how to solve all the puzzles right off the bat)  

**2) They don't teach you a unique item mechanic** (Because none of them have items)

**3) Because any aspect of the beasts puzzles can be done in any order (and the beasts themselves can be done in any order), all the puzzles are treated like ""babies first puzzle"" and don't build off of each other to train the player and create a more complex puzzle network to build player mastery.**

**4) All the Dungeon puzzles you do see, the player has already mastered, because they recycle the same 5 sheikah slate powers over and over again into ad nauseum** (really 3 slate powers, since the cube bomb only exists so you can place two bombs at once and the water freeze ability is required *maybe* 6 times in the entire game, even including the DLC) 

**5) The boss fight is not a puzzle that tests a player's mastery of an item (because there is no item), but rather a combat encounter that has nothing to do with the puzzles and tasks the player has been doing for the past hour.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*I rant about BotW all the time on this subreddit. I'm sure most people here know there's an overwhelming dislike of the game on the reddit, if not from be by the other dozens of people who voice the same opinions*  ***So why am I talking about this again?***

Regardless of how much you enjoyed BotW or not, the approach to dungeon design in Breath of the Wild is *fundamentally different* to the dungeon design that shows up consistently and is repeated across Ocarina, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. Even if WW and SS's dungeons are far more linear than OoT's and MM's, they at the very least all belong in the same category of dungeon design, one which is distinctly separate from BotW's. And both of those categories of dungeon design are fundamentally different from the 2D Zelda games (which far more often don't have a ""dungeon mechanic"", only an ""item mechanic"", and the puzzles tend to be one-note and room-oriented, rather than having a dungeon-spanning mechanic) as well. 

The last time I asked a question on this subreddit about the dungeon design in the Zelda series, more than half the answers were about ""Breath of the Wild design"". That's fine, I'm glad someone enjoyed that game. But it had nothing to do with what I actually wanted to talk about: Dungeon design in 3D titles prior to BotW. I was writing up a new text post for this sub where I wanted to talk about and explore how items are typically used as gating when I realized the same exact bloody thing was going to happen if I were to ask ""About Dungeon Design"" without specifying Pre-BotW somehow. The fact that there's even this divide in the series where I need to specify that before I can talk about the thing I actually want to talk about is driving me f***ing crazy. 

I've had this same issue on the Discord channel, and throughout the fandom. If I wanted to flair a post somehow to indicate that I wanted to talk about this specific aspect of the series design (the dungeons of the Pre-Botw 3D titles), What term do I use? What do I flair the posts as? 

I feel like we need new terminology to discuss the Zelda series and the mechanics of gameplay in it. Separating the Divine Beasts out is pretty easy, just refer to them as ""Divine Beasts"" instead of as Dungeons. But we come across probably my biggest point here. 

**""Dungeon"" itself is outdated. The term was absolutely useless *before* Breath of the Wild even came out. It has no meaning, not in the Zelda series, not even in Video games as a whole.** 

Darkest Dungeon has dungeons. It's a roguelike. 
Diablo has Dungeons. It's a Dungeon Crawler.
Zelda has Dungeons. It's an Action Adventure Puzzler. 
World of Warcraft has Dungeons. It's a PVP MMO. 

Barely any of the dungeons in these games are actually a *dungeon* at all. At least in the Zelda series, the only thing that comes close is the Shadow Temple of OoT. 

There are a lot of games like the Zelda series. ""Zelda-Likes"" if you will. Okami, for example, is a hell of a lot more like Zelda than Diablo is, even though all three feature ""dungeons"". Okami, Ittle Dew, Blossom Tales, Oceanhorn. These games have ""Dungeons"" that are just like the Zelda series, mechanically speaking. Semi-linear experiences that train the player and build up complex mechanics over the course of the encounter, introducing a new item or dungeon mechanic as you go through, and culminate in a boss that functions as a mechanical time-based puzzle test of the player's new item(s) and knowledge. 

**We need a new term, as a fandom, to refer to the specific things that make the Zelda series, well, Zelda.** 

Personally, I like the term ""Temple"". Although not all the places in the Zelda series that are currently considered ""dungeons"" were ever places of worship, it harkens back and alludes to Ocarina of Time perfectly - the place where the game design of the series solidified and separated between 2D style and 3D style dungeons, and ends on the definitely-places-of-worship featured by the sanctuaries of Skyward Sword, which is the ending point of this theoretical category of level design. 

Is there another term you like more? Do feel like ""Action Adventure"" isn't enough to categorize a subset of games that ought to be more recognized as a genre? Does anyone else think ""Dungeon"" is a useless term? Does anyone else want better terminology to talk about these things? ",28,public,,0

truezelda,t3_ais2vg,Is it true that Koizumi‚Äôs wife is the reason why Link is bishonen from Oot onwards?,"I‚Äôve read many times over the web that Oot Link was originally going to be an average looking character, then Koizumi‚Äôs wife complained that Nintendo didn‚Äôt have any good looking protagonists and they decided to make Link a pretty looking protagonist, which resulted in the Links from Oot, TP, SS and Botw to be the somewhat androgynous iconic designs everyone knows and thinks Link always looked like.

truezelda,t3_aims07,"Enjoying the little characterization Link gets / characterization you‚Äôd like to see in the future, if any?","I‚Äôve always liked that a lot of Link‚Äôs personality is left to the players‚Äô imagination, but there are also a number of times he‚Äôs shown to have a significant emotional response to something. I find I also really like these moments, as I usually get pretty attached to him, and maybe also because that show of emotion is made more poignant by the fact that he‚Äôs silent most of the time. 

I also know some others would like him to show more emotion sometimes, but I kind of like that his characterization is subtle enough that people are able to have their own different interpretations of what he‚Äôs like: like a lot of people, WW with his expressiveness and little victory dance seems a bit excitable and coveys a sense of wonderment to me. TP strikes me as a kind, supportive soul with the concern he shows others and the warm smiles he gives Midna when she needs them. I thought OOT and MM seemed a lonely, thankless hero, though that‚Äôs based a bit more on certain plot elements rather than emotional responses from him, etc. 

Do you have a favorite Link based on personality?
Is there a certain kind of emotional reaction to a situation you‚Äôd want explored in a future Link?
What traits (helpfulness, purity of heart, enjoying sleep, etc) if any, would you consider to be integral for a Link to have?
Also, are there any traits, if any, you specifically would *not* want a Link to have‚Äîsomething that would make you think, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not Link‚Äù?",54,public,,0

truezelda,t3_aj1wr5,Why I Think Link and Medli Can Be Togther,"Disclaimer: Before we begin, I just want to say that I have no problem with Link and Tetra being together. I adore that pairing too. Same goes for Medli and Komali. 

Of all the Zelda pairings I've seen, one that I've noticed that doesn't get enough love is Link x Medli. I can kind of understand why, considering that they're technically 2 different species, However let's go over what we have here, apart from the beak and wings, Medli is practically the same as any other human. We do not know for sure if Humans and Ritos can coexist or not but I personally think that they can. If you give Hotski 20 golden feathers to give to his girlfriend, his girlfriend actually writes you back with a piece of heart. In that letter his girlfriend writes that she's sort of a ""bird enthusiast"" and it's implied that she's actually human. If she IS human, then that must mean that humans and Rito's are compatible in some way.

There are also some things in the game itself that hint at a possible relationship between Link and Medli: 

1) On the cover of the game, Medli is the ONLY person on the whole cover who is looking at Link. 

2) In the original game, if you use the Tingle Tuner in Dragon Roost Cavern, after getting the Grappling Hook from Medli, Tingle will mention that it must mean that Link and Medli are getting closer. 

3) When carrying Medli you can use the C-Stick to look up her skirt (even though she actually wears pants)

4) Once Ganon is defeated, both Medli and Makar don't need to pray for the Master Sword anymore. So Medli is free to be with Link

5) Most important. When Medli is playing her harp at the hill top, Link can actually offer to give her a Golden Feather, even though she respectfully declines because practicing is her first priority, just the fact that your able to do that must show that Link clearly has SOME feelings for her. 


Even if they aren't compatible, Link and Medli can still be together. As long as they love each other that would be enough for them. They don't have to have sex to be happy together. (But if they ARE compatible, then Link can cum inside all he want's ;P)

truezelda,t3_aidxcz,"If there‚Äôs one thing I believe most of us can agree on, it‚Äôs that the next Zelda game should allow us to swim freely underwater","One thing I was so excited for in BoTW was swimming and diving to explore Hyrule underwater. However, we all know how that turned out. We were allowed to swim above water but were still limited by our stamina. 


I believe that the next Zelda game should incorporate swimming and diving (preferably like in Skyward Sword with perhaps the help of an item). By allowing the players to explore Hyrule underwater, a whole new world opens up with a plethora of new enemies as well. I‚Äôd also love to see the Zora tunic and Iron boots make a return. 


Now, some people may disagree as their first thought is ‚ÄúNot another water temple!‚Äù But I would like to point out that the Cistern in Skyward Sword is very well received and that made use of swimming as a form of exploration to further progression, yet most of the dungeon took place above water. 


Overall, I‚Äôd just like to see what secret we could discover under Hyrule‚Äôs rivers and lakes. I can imagine diving down in the ocean only to see cracks with bubbles rising out from them. I dive down and squeeze my way through only to discover a coral reef with fish of every color. 


Would you like to swim in the next Zelda game? If so, what things would you like to be added surrounding swimming and how would you like swimming to work? Would it require an item or not? What areas would be blocked off unless you can swim? What secrets will swimming reveal?",227,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aij7q1,Lore question: What do you think a noble pursuit is made out of?,"The ingredients I would say are most likely are:

Hydro melon

Palm Fruit

Cool safflina

Voltfruit

Wild berry

Cane Sugar

Some kind of alcohol

Ice (can‚Äôt really be an ingredient since it‚Äôs not a collectible item, but we know the drink contains ice because of the side quest. Most likely the drink is served on the rocks or with crushed ice)



According to BOTW physics, it can only have 5 ingredients (not counting the ice). Which fruits do you guys think go in it?


I‚Äôm guessing it would be:

Hydromelon, Palmfruit, Wildberry, Cane Sugar, and the alcohol would be the fifth ingredient.


A real life recipe would be: 


Watermelon, coconut shavings, raspberry, sugar, and vodka, blended and served with ice. If we were to break Breath of the Wild‚Äôs rules and add a sixth ingredient, I think mint would be a good addition for a ‚Äúcooling‚Äù effect like you‚Äôd get from a cool safflina.

truezelda,t3_aihsc2,Could the Master Sword Pedestal in ALttP be the remains of the Temple of Time?,"In Twilight Princess, the Temple of Time is worn down as the Lost Woods grew into the old Hyrule Castle(Town) from Ocarina of Time, so the Master Sword appeared in the woods.

What if the same thing happened in A Link to the Past? Except this time, the Lost Woods hit even harder, so the only remnant of the Temple of Time is just the Master Sword pedestal (I guess it still unlocks with three special charms).

ALttP and TP could have happened at similar times, just in different timelines. ALttP is 100-200 years after OoT, and TP could be 100-200 years after TP, because TP Link is the next ""hero"" after OoT Link. In both timelines, Hyrule Castle is remade in the center of Hyrule, so the Temple of Time in both worlds would have been left behind.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: BotW is a strange case for me. The Temple of Time was built on the Sealed Temple, right? Well, BotW has both the Temple of Time and the Forgotten Temple in different locations. If the Forgotten Temple was just a rebuild of the Sealed Temple but in a different location, then the Temple of Time very well may be the same case, along with the possible Hyrule Castle Town around it. Because of the thin line between lore and reference, I didn't consider BotW in this theory. ",10,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aibsr4,How would you all feel if the next Zelda went for an open world progression in the same vein as Dark Souls?,"I‚Äôm of the opinion that botw‚Äôs go anywhere anytime was somewhat to its detriment, no dungeon items as they need to be doable in any order, no real linear story etc. and I‚Äôve seen this opinion shared by a lot of people here so I‚Äôm curious to know how people would feel about the next Zelda game handling the openness like Dark Souls, being just as open as botw, if you can see it you can go there at any time, though some doors may be locked, but there‚Äôs a clearly defined linear progression through the world. 

Dark Souls 1 and 2 open with you having a lot of different paths you can take only one of which is the correct one. Dark souls 1 opens with 3 paths, one easy path, one with enemies you can‚Äôt hit, and another with enemies that need to be killed twice (and at launch wouldn‚Äôt give souls/xp) so there‚Äôs an obvious intended path for you to take. The other paths will most likely kick your ass but there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from going down them though eventually you will likely hit a wall of some kind that you need to progress down the other paths to get rid of. 

Next Zelda could work in a similar way, you can go anywhere with a few exceptions from the start, but you‚Äôll have a hard time of it and may find things to be significantly easier with tools you get from the intended path, or you may find things to not be possible without them. On the other hand though, if they make enemy and weapon strength tied to areas you could get some super strong stuff right away by running through the harder paths. Story events could be handled fairly easily, rather than tying them to specific dungeons make them quest based and do the dungeons in waves ie. dungeon 1-3 need to be done before you can do dungeon 4 which needs to be done to access 5-9 etc. ",41,public,,0

truezelda,t3_ahs04p,Zelda 2 is not a Black Sheep,"From fans to Miyamoto himself, there seems to be a great disliking of Zelda 2, at least in comparison to the other games in the franchise. Because of its stark difficulty and different game-play from the other 2d games, it is usually seen as an outlier in the series, but, as i am playing through it for the first time on the switch, I begin to see how this game created many of the series staples that are synonymous with Zelda as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although the 2d side-scrolling is different from the other games in the series, this concept was re-utilized in many of the 2d sequels, especially on the game boy. Sure, the combat is different, however there are sections in Links awakening, for example, that are 2d platformers, albeit nowhere near as long as Zelda 2's game-play.

&amp;#x200B;

Zelda 2 also introduced side quests and towns which are seen today in every zelda since.

&amp;#x200B;

Dark Link, a common recurring enemy in Zelda, was introduced here as well as the reincarnation of Ganon, a common trope throughout many of the games.

&amp;#x200B;

The magic meter was introduced here at full force, which was further developed in the n64 games (and was at one point in BotW before being removed in development).

&amp;#x200B;

The importance of combat and learning new skills were created here too. Ever since, most 3d zeldas have taken time to teach link new sword techniques, with TP being the most obvious case of this. Speaking of combat, the way each enemy feels like a puzzle to face is reminiscent of how combat was utilized in skyward sword as you had to think carefully about fighting enemies in each game.

&amp;#x200B;

Heck, all three links in smash take their sword strikes from Zelda 2. The influence of the game is still present outside of the series today.

&amp;#x200B;

Although i can see why fans would not like Zelda 2, as it has not aged well in comparison to others, it is by no means a black sheep in a franchise that it has greatly influenced.",76,public,,0
truezelda,t3_ahr6tg,How big do you think Hyrule actually is?,"Obviously because it‚Äôs a game they can‚Äôt include thousands of people and dozens of towns. But I mean Ocarina probably has like 50 people total in the game, at least Hylians, and that‚Äôs like the size of a small neighborhood. Even BotW has probably less than or around 200 people. Most games have just one or two hylian towns also which is minuscule. Basically the same story for the other races. So is there anything that implies how big Hyrule is or is there a headcanon you have of just how big the country is?",41,public,,0
truezelda,t3_ahmrpz,8 Divine Beasts,"So I've been thinking about the divine beasts and how they were designed to destroy the Calamity. The ancient Sheikah created the divine beasts to aid the Hero in defeating Ganon, However I believe they were supposed to destroy Ganon outright rather than just wounding him (it?). Four divine beasts attacking at once can leave the Calamity with about half his strength remaining, so logic would dictate that eight or more divine beasts could injure Ganon enough that a descendent of Hylia could kill him/it.

Well let's look at the divine beasts we have.

1. Vah Ruta, Divine beast of the Zoras.

2. Vah Rudania, Divine beast of the Gorons.

3. Vah Medoh, Divine beast of the Rito.

4. Vah Naboris, Divine beast of the Gerudo.

Four beasts, each one belonging to a different people.
But there is a fifth divine beast, The Master Cycle Zero.
I believe the MCZ was a prototype for an equine divine beast intended for the Hylians, Which is supported by the fact that Link, A Hylian is the one who was granted the MCZ.

But that's only five divine beasts. Not enough to kill Ganon. Yet there are still two races of Hyrule who don't have a divine beast. They are the Koroks and the Sheikah themselves. If they both had a divine beast, then we'd have seven in total. Still not enough to end the Calamity. However, there is still one person left who the Sheikah could craft a divine beast for. Zelda. The descendant of Hylia has always been vital in defeating Ganon. And if she had a divine beast then we'd have eight in total. Enough to kill Ganon.

The unfinished beast beneath the Shrine of Resurrection shows us that there could be yet more undiscovered/unfinished divine beasts in Hyrule. If the seven races of Hyrule plus the heir to Hylia all had divine beasts, then Ganon could be slaughtered with almost no risk to the Hero or Heir and no need of the Master Sword, meaning that Ganon wouldn't have time to plan around the divine beasts if the Hero hadn't obtained the Master Sword by the time Ganon returned.


What do you think? Could there be more divine beasts out there? Or have I missed something that completely destroys my theory? Thanks for reading.",61,public,,0
truezelda,t3_ahp2ay,Did Ganondorf‚Äôs attempted genocide cause Gorons to flee Hyrule during the DT?,"Out of all races punished by Ganondorf in Oot Gorons had it the worst: genocide by feeding them all to Volvagia. Maybe the news of Ganondorf getting the whole Triforce made them panic, fearing the worst for their race was about to happen, and they fled Hyrule as soon as possible.

They would come back to Hyrule thousands of years later, and by Botw they feel comfortable with Hyrule once again.

Notes on the Translation

The events described as occurring prior to those played out in Ocarina of Time (and the far flung backstory of A Link to the Past) seem to have been muddled with the events of Ocarina of Time itself and the events of A Link to the Past, with a few subtle changes (i.e., refinements).

For example, this is the sequence of events as told by the above texts‚Ä¶
(bracketed ‚Äú[]‚Äù points are assumed lore from other titles):

&gt;The wars for the Triforce occurred long before the construction of the Temple of Time and the sealing of the Triforce in the Sacred Realm by the Seven Sages. (OoT ‚Äúlegend‚Äù, ALttP manual)

&gt;Sometime later, the thief Ganondorf uncovered the hidden Sacred Realm. (OoT, ALttP manual)

&gt;By obtaining the entire power of the Triforce [seven years later], he became the ‚ÄúGreat Demon King‚Äù, Ganon! (HH:OoT [DT], ALttP manual)

&gt;Ganon brought his campaign to Hyrule [in the guise of the priest, Agahnim]; the castle fell under his command. (ALttP)

&gt;He was sealed away by the ‚ÄúHero‚Äù, who wielded the Master Sword combined with the ‚Äúpower of the Seven Sages‚Äù [i.e., the power carried by their descendants]. (ALttP)

&gt;After Ganon was sealed away, the Triforce was split into three‚Ä¶one piece stayed with the Royal Family, another was sealed up with Ganon, and the last remained with the ‚Äúsoul of the hero‚Äù. (Revision: post-ALttP)

As you can see, the story being shared can reflect the current understanding of the lore from multiple sources‚ÄîOoT, ALttP, and then some‚Äîto create a setting for the events of ALBW to take place. It's simply a summary!",35,public,,0
truezelda,t3_ah2uk4,Could a hypothetical Zelda tv show get away with keeping Link mute if he was surrounded by a large supporting cast?,"This is a question I‚Äôve been trying to figure out an answer to for awhile. Many in the past have discussed translating Zelda to either cinemas or television, but something no one can usually agree on is how to handle Link as a character. Some say, of course Link should talk. You can‚Äôt have the main character of your show be silent! But others say, Link talking would be weird. Just have a fairy talk for him like in other games instead.

I‚Äôm here to raise a different idea and see what people think about it. Nowadays, ensemble casts are basically a must for television. You don‚Äôt really get many shows focused around a single person. Even Samurai Jack (a show which focused only on Jack with some characters recurring as villains or allies in certain episodes) gained a secondary main character when it returned for a final season. Every modern superhero show needs to have a whole team of friends behind them, every drama needs to have a group of people who take turns being the focus of episodes, it‚Äôs just a staple of tv.

So would an ensemble fix the issue of Link‚Äôs voice? Let‚Äôs say they threw in Zelda, and maybe one main character from the most popular races in the series. Maybe have Impa in there and then a Goron and a Zora. If we followed this cast from episode to episode, and sometimes one of them would get major focus for an episode or arc, all while acknowledging Link‚Äôs silence, would things work out?

It‚Äôs really hard to say. One might decide that Link being silent is still a negative because he will inevitably be a less popular character than the more talkative costars. Someone else could argue that any form of supporting cast would make the show feel unlike anything related to the Legend of Zelda and Link should definitely be on his own.

But the title of this post was a question, and so a question it shall be. Do you guys think an ensemble cast would allow them to keep Link as mute, or do you think that would be an awful idea?

Edit: I feel like the range of responses and ideas on this post show how much of a debate this still is.",61,public,,0
truezelda,t3_agx4nw,King in the Mountain,"Did you know there was a king that lived during the Era of the Goddess Hylia?

&gt;All right, then... I'm gonna let you in on an ancient treasure-hunting legend passed down among generations of Mogmas. Every Mogma worth a handful o' dirt knows this one... ""Ye who seek the entrance to **the king's treasure**, look for the two statues that face one another. Show your bravery and jump into the mouth of the sleeping statue. Do this, and the path will open before you.""

&gt;Guld, Mogma Leader, in the Fire Sanctuary, *Skyward Sword*

Working out the puzzle of the sleeping statue leads Link to a chamber with another puzzle. In this chamber there is a tablet with the following inscription:

&gt;Bring light to each statue in accordance with the number of wings each possesses, from least to most. When light resides in each statue, **the king's treasure shall be yours**.

What is the King's Treasure? It's the [Mysterious Crystals](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/4/4e/Mysterious_Crystals.png/revision/latest?cb=20120124023052) (same name in Japanese). They are described in the game this way:

&gt;You got the Mysterious Crystals! This mass is made up of faintly glowing square crystals. Several are missing.

Mysterious indeed. What exactly are they? All we know is that they are used in the Fire Sanctuary to unlock the way to what the Sanctuary protects - Din's Flame. 

But, who was this king from the ancient past?

Since his treasure is kept in the Fire Sanctuary, and it's used as a key to access Din's Flame, I think it's safe to assume that he was at least partly responsible in building the Fire Sanctuary. He may have worked with Eldin, the Dragon, to protect Din's Flame. 

We're told that Hylia put each of the Sacred Flames under the protection of one of the Dragons. Nayru's Flame was placed on a ship sailed by Ancient Robots. The Ancient Robots call Lanayru their master. They also say that they haven't seen a human in a long time, and that it's too dangerous for humans, because of the Timeshift (Spacetime) Stones. So, it's fair to say that the predominant civilization of the Lanayru Region was that of the Ancient Robots. 

It's also reasonable to say that some sort of civilization also existed in the Eldin Region. This is what Eldin says about the Eldin Volcano:

&gt;This mountain was not always such a dangerous and unforgiving place. There was a time when those above-ground and those below lived together in harmony by the blessing of the great mountain. The desolation that you see now is all that remains to remind us of those glorious days....

So, a society lived on the mountain. It was a union between those below ground, the Mogma, and those above.

We see evidence for this civilization from the massive mines that have been carved into the mountain, and the impressive structures of the Earth Temple and Fire Sanctuary. 

The Mogmas couldn't have done this all by themselves. They would have worked with those who lived above-ground. Who could those above-ground be? The answer that comes immediately to mind is the Gorons. We know that the Gorons are famous for their mining activities. They also like to live on volcanic mountains. 

But, was the king connected to the Fire Sanctuary, who may have ruled in this area, really either a Mogma or Goron?

Well, to reach the Fire Sanctuary, you must go through an extremely hot part of the volcano. Link needs the Fireshield Earrings to get through. Its a perfect place to protect one of the Sacred Flames. This hot area would be no problem for a Goron, and we know that the Mogmas can just dig their way underground into the Fire Sanctuary. So, it's definitely possible that both races helped to build the Sanctuary. 

But, the architecture of the Fire Sanctuary makes it a bit hard to believe that they they were the only ones involved. Apart from not looking like any structure we've seen connected to the two races before, there are a number of statues, and images, inside the Fire Sanctuary. Some look like amphibians, and others look like dragons or monsters. But there's also a number of statues that look like different types of birds.

For instance, the room containing the King's Treasure has a puzzle using [bird totems](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14/Walkthrough/14/1435.jpg). Solving this puzzle gets you the Mysterious Crystals, the King's Treasure. 

Inside the entrance of the Fire Sanctuary are some more [bird statues](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/2765680.jpg?1490641954). These look like owls *with crowns on their heads*. Is this a reference to the king?

Finally, in the chamber unlocked by the King's Treasure, which leads to the Sacred Flame, are [two massive statues]( https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/published/9511090.png?1502655382) of a different species of birds. Though you can't see it in this image, these birds are also wearing crowns. 

So, the image of a bird seems to be strongly connected with the king. I really can't see how the king could be a Goron, or a Mogma, with this type of imagery.

But, there is an important thing to keep in my about the image of a bird in SS. Birds are connected with the winged Goddess Hylia. In fact, between the two massive crowned bird statues, in the Fire Sanctuary, there is a mural depicting Hylia. As far as I can tell, this is a unique image of Hylia with its almost [Egyptian-like headpiece](https://www.architectureofzelda.com/uploads/3/7/1/2/37126503/7006313_orig.png). Perhaps it reflects the unique view that the people of Eldin Volcano had for the Goddess. On either side of her is the image of a Gate of Time. One in the Temple of Time, the other in the Temple of Hylia. Buildings connected to Hylia usually have statues of Loftwings. In the Skyview Temple there are images of birds too, including a massive structure shaped like a bird at its centre.

Therefore, do the numerous statues of crowned birds in the Fire Sanctuary mean that the king was connected to Hylia? Did he rule under the authority of Hylia?

It makes sense. We see evidence of the influence, and authority, of Hylia in all the regions of the Surface. The king, who seems to have helped in building the Fire Sanctuary, must have ruled underneath Her Grace. Also, the mural seems to imply that the king was aware of the Gates of Time, created by Hylia, in the other regions of the Surface.

So then, if the crowned bird is a symbol of a king under Hylia, it doesn't rule out the possibility that this king was a Goron, or a Mogma. 

At least, not yet...

In the next post I do on this subject, I would like to explore what we can learn from the Faron Woods region, before returning to Eldin Volcano.

In the meantime, I'd love to hear any theories or thoughts you might have about who this king could be, or what the Mysterious Crystals were. 

**Real World Folklore and Legends**

One last thing, the [King in the Mountain](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_the_mountain) is a common motif found in folklore and legends all around the world. 

&gt;King in the mountain stories involve legendary heroes, often accompanied by armed retainers, sleeping in remote dwellings, including caves on high mountaintops, remote islands, or supernatural worlds. The hero is frequently a historical figure of some military consequence in the history of the nation where the mountain is located.

The idea that the king is a legendary hero is interesting...

The Brothers Grimm have a well-known version:

&gt;The presence of the hero is unsuspected, until some herdsman wanders into the cave, typically looking for a lost animal, and sees the hero. The stories almost always mention the detail that the hero has grown a long beard, indicative of the long time he has slept beneath the mountain.

&gt;The hero speaks with the herdsman. Their conversation typically involves the hero asking, ""Do the eagles (or ravens) still circle the mountaintop?"" The herdsman, or a mysterious voice, replies, ""Yes, they still circle the mountaintop."" ""Then begone! My time has not yet come.""

&gt;The herdsman in this story was then supernaturally harmed by the experience: he ages rapidly, he emerges with his hair turned white, and often he dies after repeating the tale. The story goes on to say that the king sleeps in the mountain, awaiting a summons to arise with his knights and defend the nation in a time of deadly peril. The omen that presages his rising will be the extinction of the birds that trigger his awakening.

Notice the connection to birds, and the supernatural passing of time (rapid ageing - mural of Gates of Time).

Japan has their own version of the legend:

&gt;K≈´kai, founder of Shingon Buddhism. He is said to be in deep meditation in a temple on Mount K≈çya, Wakayama Prefecture, awaiting the coming of Maitreya, the next Buddha.

This is interesting because Buddhism is going to come up a lot later on.

truezelda,t3_agy187,Are the Gerudo being far more evil in MM than in any other games the result of the lack of a real authority in Termina?,"Compared to other Zelda games, Gerudo in MM stand out as being far more prone to cruelty such as beating Mikau to death and stealing unborn babies to the black market.

Could this be a result of Termina not having a true central government like the royal family of Hyrule?

The Swamp has a goverment that has nothing to do with Clock Town, to the point that Termina feels more like a geographic location than a nation.

truezelda,t3_ah2hqb,My Personal Ranking of the 3D Zelda Game Endings and Credits,"One of my favorite parts of Zelda games are the endings. I feel a lot of games, especially nowadays don‚Äôt seem to really care about their endings or just sort of tack them on. Zelda games usually have pretty good endings that I look forward to throughout the game. Of course this is my opinion.

6.) Breath of the Wild.

The only Zelda ending that I consider to be kind of bad. Essentially Link and Zelda reunite and they talk for a bit. The only real point made here is that Zelda found her power and now the silent princess is symbolically blooming everywhere. I don‚Äôt really care that much though. Zelda doesn‚Äôt seem that passionate about her power, Link doesnt seem to care that much about it, or anything else to be honest . The credits are likely the worst of any Zelda game. The music here is unmemorable and it‚Äôs visually uninteresting. Overall my least favorite.

5.) Majora‚Äôs Mask

I like this ending and I‚Äôm surprised by how low it is. However I just don‚Äôt really think it has much to say story wise or thematically imo. The game just kind of ends and everyone celebrates during the credits. I like seeing the wedding and I like seeing thee NPCs we interacted with over the game finding their place. The Deku Butler part is interesting but I personally don‚Äôt like it. I know Majoras Mask is supposed to be more melancholy, but it just masked me kind of sad. That‚Äôs not a complaint on the endings quality, it‚Äôs just a thematic preference.

4.) Twilight Princess

At first I thought this ending was kinda lame but it has grown on me. I think the melancholy of Midna breaking the mirror is great since Link and Midnas bonding over the course of the game is the best part of the story imo.  They can‚Äôt be together since the connection of their two worlds caused so much havoc. Also the credits are pretty great. I feel like the Ordon kid now having a sword and shield implies that he‚Äôs been inspired by Link courage and is gonna be his successor. Also Link riding off at the end is great fallback to Ocarina that‚Äôs also kind of sad since I think this implies that Link is searching for another entrance to the twilight realm so he can see midna again. 

3.) Wind Waked

Amazing ending. Thematically this is probably my favorite. The death of the kind, the drowning of Hyrule. Link leaving his sister and grandmother because he‚Äôs grown up and pursuing a new future for his people beyond the great seas.  It‚Äôs a great tale of growing up and burying the past. Love it.

2.) Skyward Sword. Amazing. I was originally gonna put this at no.1. I really felt like when Skyward Sword came out on Zelda‚Äôs 25th anniversary, it was a meant to be such a love letter to the fanbase. Whether you were fulfilled or not, to me this ending shows that intent. It feels so finished and like the creators really took their time to make this ending elegant as possible. There are so many character moments here. Fi leaving. Impa dying. Grooss returning to the Sky. Zelda and Link staying behind to establish Hyrule. I love the credits and how they show Zelda‚Äôs story during the games events. Also the credits music is my favorite piece of music in any Zelda game. Also the final shot of the loft wings flying away and the ‚Äúthe end‚Äù really makes it feel like a bookend. It‚Äôs such a beautiful and polished ending.

1.) Ocarina of Time.

You can‚Äôt beat this one imo. I feel that it goes on and on but in a good way. This game is long as fuck and it the ending should feel satisfying because of it. Everything is touched on. All the Minor NPCs, minor characters, the sages. Most importantly for me though, it gives the most depth to Link. Navis leaving in the temple of time, and Link stepping away from the master sword represents that now Link no longer has the mind of a child nor the body of an adult.  Also bonus points to the 3DS version with the extra credits. I love that soundtrack.",6,public,,0
truezelda,t3_agswsd,What would have happened if Ganon returned to the Light World in ALTTP?,"Zelda and two of the Maidens say that Ganon will be unstoppable if he returns to the Light World:

Kholdstare Maiden: ""Already there is little time until the portal created at the castle that connects Light and Dark opens completely.""

Zelda when you rescue her from Trinexx: ""(Ganon) is waiting for the time when he will slip through the passage between the two worlds.

truezelda,t3_agmbht,Is there any actual evidence supporting the ‚ÄúZelda team doesn‚Äôt care about story/continuity‚Äù claim that is constantly thrown around?,"You hear it all the time, especially in the main Zelda/Nintendo subreddits.  Typically it‚Äôs paired with a separate claim such as ‚Äúthe Zelda team doesn‚Äôt have any interest in the timeline, lore, continuity and it‚Äôs only the fans who are so concerned.‚Äù 

Many times the true claim that Nintendo generally comes up with interesting gameplay concepts before finalizing the story is used as support, but nowhere does the aforementioned truth entail an aversion to heavy story focus.

While the contested claim seems obviously contradicted by the games‚Äô themselves having significant story focus, I would be interested if there is any evidence in support of it given how widespread it is.  As far as I can tell, the only individual involved with Zelda who has a confirmed aversion to large story focus is Miyamoto, who specifically dislikes large amounts of dialogue and text in games if memory serves.  Of course he has been less involved since Ocarina, which was itself more story driven than its predecessor.  To my knowledge the only game he has since intervened in to diminish story focus was Four Swords Adventures, which would have originally covered the Sealing War.  

So is there anything to the claim, or is it just a misconception?",21,public,,0
truezelda,t3_agk0ej,Dark Ages is just a ridiculous argument.,"Ill be honest I couldn‚Äôt come up with a better title,

But I would like to propose as to why the whole concept of the ‚ÄúDark ages‚Äù is silly to explain any era for any Zelda game is just fundamentally ridiculous argument. But it‚Äôs also kinda a defense of Skyward Sword.

To me Skyward Sword succeeds at three important core design elements, combat (including item useage, bosses, and enemies and just combat in general) dungeons, and puzzles! Why? Well it‚Äôs simple the game treats combat in a way that essentially can be described as Samurai like, it‚Äôs slow, requires patience, you have to read enemies to understand their position and movement when it comes to weapons, and you get fluidity and a dynamic sense of control, plus the motion controls were good for its time. Is it perfect and therefore couldn‚Äôt be improved upon? No! But it was good for what it had to offer. Plus the dungeons and puzzles support the combat because they are all tied together, I mean the best puzzles were the more combat focused ones. This is how the combat felt to [me](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jeG215-yu-k)
Plus the world as a dungeon was a nice game design edition to the game. However it had serious flaws that understanbly would have others say it was the worse Zelda game ever!

Now my main point? Every Zelda game is a good game (even TP and BOTW which I bregrudginly accept) 
I think the issue is we have been focusing so much on what makes the perfect Zelda game that we never give a fair shot to other Zelda games and try to understand what is good about them. Now I‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt legitimate criticisms or that every Zelda game has to be different but I feel like we have fallen into the trap of treating the critics like the gaming sultans of the world instead of just random people you can disagree or agree on.
I decided myself to not care if a Zelda game gets a 5/10 or a 7/10 because why would I care? To some folks the original NES Zeldas are the golden ages of Zelda, to others it‚Äôs the N64, to some it‚Äôs the GameCube, others it‚Äôs the Wii era, or here is a shocking thought, maybe there were multiple golden age eras of Zelda depending on whom you ask. The problem is reducing down to eras, makes no sense because well maybe to someone in 1987 the original Zelda game was a terrible game for some odd reason. It‚Äôs redundant, and it essentially boils down to ‚Äúobjectivity fallacy‚Äù I love OOT but I could easily rip it apart compared to earlier Zelda games due to massive design issues, same with ALTTP! They are equally valid as to why X game is the golden era because it depends on what you want!
Hell I could make the same argument about why 2D Mario is objectively better than 2D Zelda and 3D Mario from a game design point of view but that would be silly because it wouldn‚Äôt be objective because others have the right to disagree and it would be silly state it would be objectively better.

Maybe I‚Äôm doing a terrible job of explaining but I feel like the fandom in general should just embrace unpopular opinions. I say embrace diverse opinions!",21,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aggwu3,"What does ""good game, but a bad Zelda game"" really mean?","This is a ridiculous complaint that I see all over the place regarding most of the more recent Zelda games (relatively speaking). It's started to annoy me, and I just have to rant about it now.

* Twilight Princess is a ""good game, but a bad Zelda game"" because it's not surprising or fresh as its predecessors.
* Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks are ""good games, but bad Zelda games"" because they don't have real overworlds and they have touch controls.
* Skyward Sword is a ""good game, but a bad Zelda game"" because it heavily deemphasizes exploration and has motion controls.
* Breath of the Wild is a ""good game, but a bad Zelda game"" because its dungeons are tiny and homogenous and because it doesn't have the item gating that previous Zelda games have.

Anyway, it just seems that it exposes the fandom's fragmentation for preferring different aspects of Zelda. Which I still think is ridiculous Zelda is about everything: exploring, dungeoneering, fighting, puzzle solving, storytelling, and character interaction. The best Zelda games (read: the SNES-N64 golden age) are the ones that balance those aspects the best. And the fact that Zelda fans have to focus on one aspect over the other is totally missing the point of the series.

Honestly, the only recent Zelda game that seems to escape this is A Link Between Worlds. And guess what, the reason why is that it *balances* the core Zelda elements. It's innovative, has a great overworld, a great dungeon game, and compelling characters.",73,public,,0

truezelda,t3_ag276u,I Know This Will Be Unpopular But I Really Want Nintendo to Release a Gritty T or M rated Zelda,"And before someone calls me some insecure Mountain Dew-fueled teenager, let me explain.

I don‚Äôt want some gore-fest full of unnecessary obscenity and a sex mini game or some shit, Injust want something kinda mature with some blood at the level of like Skyrim or LOTR.

I know people will say that‚Äôs not on the spirit of Zelda, but I disagree. Look at the Art for ALTTP. It‚Äôs gritty and realistic and cool. If they had the hardware to make ALTTP look like that, they would have.

Also, Ocarina is time. In the original Ocarina of Time when you beat Ganondorf he pukes red blood everywhere, and at the end when Link slashes and stabs Ganon, blood sprayed all over the place. Why can‚Äôt we go back to this? Also there were torture devices stained with blood in the shadow temple, and the dead hand is covered in dry blood.

Zelda was not originally meant to be for kids. It was meant to be slightly mature to the point where the target demographic wasn‚Äôt the same age as Mario‚Äôs target demographic. Nintendo just made Zelda more kiddie because that makes the game have a larger audience and it fuckin sucks. 

I know Twilight Princess was kind of this way, but not enough. Ganondorf got stabbed and the great fairy is naked and actually kinda hot this time but that‚Äôs literally it.

And BOTW, just wtf. Don‚Äôt tell me that game was dark. Sure characters died but it doesn‚Äôt even matter because you literally see their ghosts and they act just like they‚Äôre alive and well and it essentially means nothing.

Windwaker is a great game but it ruined the franchise in this respect by making Zelda kiddie. Every Zelda game this decade has been kiddie Mario shit.

I mean, Zelda  was meant to be cool and quasi-realistic, but now it‚Äôs just starting to adapt this kiddie anime art style and it sucks.

truezelda,t3_afxn6g,The Mark of the Triforce ‚Äì Connections between Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild,"I've made a post related to this subject on both my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BslODgCgYlA/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1g28o1vv89oik) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tglmudora/status/1084843965172670466?s=19) accounts. I wanted to share here with you all. Please share your thoughts &amp; opinions regarding this subject in an orderly fashion below.

EDIT:
The ""mark of the Triforce"" is a crest that appears on the back of Link's hand in Skyward Sword, well before he physically retrieves the pieces of the Triforce itself. Zelda (Hylia) remarks that this symbol proves that he is worthy to obtain it, and that a ""sacred force"" exists within him.

Furthermore, when she blesses the Master Sword, its quillon open up, its colour becomes more intense, and a mark of the Triforce appears on the steel of the blade. She's said to have blessed it with ""the goddess's power.""

Queue Breath of the Wild. Princess Zelda, a descendant of Hylia's goddess blood, possesses a sacred force; a sealing power. It's a gift that's been passed down through generations of princesses of the Hyrule royal family. And it manifests as a mark of the Triforce on the back of their hand!

Additionally, in the ""Calamity Ganon tapestry,"" the mark appears next to the princess‚Ä¶and matches most closely to the mark, representing the ""goddess's power,"" that appears on the Master Sword!

In conclusion: I don't believe that Princess Zelda's sealing power is the physical Triforce. I believe that it is the same sacred force that dwelt within SS Link and Zelda, considered/known as Goddess Hylia's power.",17,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aftevz,I want a wholly original 2D game. Not even another ALBW.,"So, I don't want to come across as shitting on ALBW because of the title ~~although Hilda is objectively a shit waifu~~. Nor do I hate on remasters or remakes. The latter two have a time,place and purpose -but that's more of a r/truegaming discussion than an r/truezelda one.

Since Ocarina of Time's release in 1998 -more specifically sicne 2004's The Minish Cap, we've had a new Zelda game [roughly every 2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda#History).

2019 is due for a new Zelda. The most likely options are the following:

1) A Majora's Mask-like asset flip for Breath of the Wild.

2) A top-down 2D Zelda

3) A remaster/remake

4) A mobile spin-off

I believe option (2) is most likely., as Aonoma recently emphasized that 2D Zelda isn't dead.

With this in mind, let's take into consideration that 2013 was the release of a A Link Between Worlds. 2015 was Tri Force heroes. 2017 was Breath of the Wild. A Link Between Worlds is a more traditional Zelda game than Tri Force Heroes, but even then it was still a psuedo-remake of A Link to the Past.

While A Link Between Worlds was enjoyable, it was in part restricted by having to be a retreading of A Link to the Past. It told, in broad strokes, the same story, with the same shtick, and featured largely the same overworld.

It doesn't feel like we've had a truly original 2D Zelda since 2009's *Spirit Tracks*... a decade ago.

It's time we have a new, original complete product. We've waited at least 6 years, if not a decade for it. And while I have enjoyed the remakes and remasters, and expect them to be ported to the Switch at some point, it certainly feels like we've been starved for original content as of late - barring the elephant in the room that is Breath of the Wild.

Do you agree with this sentiment? Would you prefer a wholly original 2D title, or a A Link Between Worlds psuedo-remake of another Zelda? Something else entirely?",63,public,,0
truezelda,t3_afpooi,Nintendo will never remaster the old school Zelda titles.,"But not for lack of trying. 

Once upon a time, the N tried to remaster ALTTP for Game Boy, and shortly into development the team wanted to do their own thing, the end result was the adventure on Kohilont we all know and love, Links Awakening.

Later on, Nintendo wanted Capcom to remaster Zeldas 1 &amp; 2 for The team to learn the GBC hardware, before moving on to their own original project, but again the team wanted go do their own thing so they switched directions towards the Triforce Trilogy, before technological complications forced them to downsize from 3 games to 2, resulting in two of my personal favorites, The Oracle series.

Later on, Nintendo attempted to remake 4 Swords on the Nintendo DS, but that team also wanted to instead go their own way, and the result was Phantom Hourglass.

Even now on the 3DS, the team was instructed to remaster ALTTP in glorious 2.5D, but the team wanted to do their own thing, and we got A Link Between Worlds instead.

I love all of these games but dammit, once just once Nintendo can we please show some love to the first 3 OG Zelda games with some form of 2.5D or 3D remasters?

truezelda,t3_ag5eoi,I‚Äôm so Sick of Zelda Games Just Being Generic Anime,"After Skyward Sword, Zelda started to have a lame art style of nothing but generic video game anime.

I like ALBW but that is not a proper art style for a sequel to a link to the past and I don‚Äôt care what anyone has to say. ALBW is just generic chibi anime. ALTTP had a chibi-ish look but that was simply because of the hardware limitations. The actual artwork is a cool quasi-realistic type thing. It‚Äôs supposed to have some great and be taken seriously like it‚Äôs a fantasy epic. ALBW just looks like an ugly low-quality anime Windwaker. Nintendo should have kept the original artwork for ALBW.

Next we have Hyrule warriors. Not only is this game anime, but the characters have hentai influence. For some reason Nintendo is opposed to making Zelda gritty at all nowadays, but they make these Hyrule warriors have gigantic bussoms pop out of their shirts. And Lana 8/ jay some kawaii desu ka hentai Loli.

Next we have Triforce heroes. Once again, Nintendo puts in the lame anime chibi design. wtf. Links awakening an ALTTP were supposed to look COOL, not like silly Mario cartoons. And he‚Äôll, at least phantom hour glass and spirit tracks used the Windwaker style which is actually interesting and not just generic video game anime.

And finally,the worst one, Breath if the Wild, which is literally just an anime art style that every single game from Japan uses nowadays. BOTW just looks like a fire emblem game or something it‚Äôs just baseline uninnovatice videogame anime.

See in the past Zelda used to be cool. I was playing through TP as a kid and my friend were too and we all agreed that it was a cool game that tons of normal people played. It was a cool, darkish fantasy adventure. Breath of the wild is just anime, which is not cool. Zelda is losing its status as a cool series by having all these hentai characters and anime influences.

Yes, many Zelda games have had anime influence in their character designs, but that doesn‚Äôt take away that it‚Äôs also supposed to be an epic western-inspired fantasy series with a Lord of the Rings type feel. It‚Äôs not supposed to be a low-grade Miyazaki rip-off with hentai influences thrown in.

And also before anyone says something like ‚Äúbut twilight princess had generic realism‚Äù WRONG. Twilight Princess was not ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù. Sure it was more realistic than other Zelda‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs was absolutely not realistic. If you put Link, or literally any character from TP in Skyrim or some other realistic game, the would look Sooooo out of place. It really is a style all it‚Äôs own.

And before someone says something like ‚Äúoh well having giant bussoms is better than having violence and blood. What‚Äôs wrong with the female body???‚Äù Also wrong. Though on principle I have no issue with the female body, it cheapens a game when you make shameless sex appeal. When a 12 or 13 year old is exposed to these characters who are sexualized, they will end up being attracted, and many will hack off to them. I know that sounds funny, but it‚Äôs obviously true. Having a bunch of teenagers jacking off to videogames is not normal behavior. The majority of kids are not exposed to this stuff. Most kids jack off to porn or magazines or fantasies or whatever, not videogames. 

However, almost every single kid has watched movies like lord of the rings where there‚Äôs fantasy violence. There are people who were exposed to orcs and dragons getting their heads lopped off as kids, and have had perfectly normal lives since every single other kid has also seen that shit.

Having these kids be exposed to anime hentai is just gonna lead to a bunch of weird kids who like hentai and have weird fetishes. Having Link cut off heads and have Gore is not gonna do shit. Everyone in society has seen that shit.",0,public,,0
truezelda,t3_afqruj,What to play next if my first Zelda game was Breath of the Wild?,"I've made around 10 save files, completed 8, found it great in some sessions, not so much in others.

Anyway, this sub might be the most critical of the game i've found so far, so i would like to know what you think it's a better title in the series than BOTW, i've seen plenty of gameplay from pretty much all 3d titles, Wind Waker seemed like the most interesting, i would probably choose Twilight Princess last if i was going by initial impressions.

truezelda,t3_afg3e4,Which enemies are Ganon's minions and which are native to Hyrule?,"Most enemies in the series are under Ganon's command, and they only appear when he's in control. But is that true for all enemies?

The easiest ones to determine as native are the animal based ones, like the bats (Keese), snakes (Rope), rats (just rats), and most bugs/spiders. Things get weird with enhanced animals, like Wolfos and Dodongos, which I'm fairly certain are native to they're own regions, but actually cause problems when Ganon has control. (Boss enemies are definitely his goons). BotW hostile animals are also native.

But what about the undead? Stalchildren came up without Ganondorf in OoT, and Stalfos are said to be the result of adults getting lost in the Lost Woods, but you usually only fight those in dungeons or when Ganon has taken over, meaning they shouldn't be natural, right? Maybe they're only under Ganon when they're equipped? Also, Redeads and Gibdo seem to protect areas in some games but are common enemies in others. Poes seem to largely go by their own standards in OoT and TP, but in Zelda 1 and ALttP, it's harder to tell.

Some environmental enemies are also hard to tell. Mad Scrubs can easily just be a part of the Deku Scrubs species, and Deku Babas are also believable, but then you get the Moldorm family which may just be spawns of the Moldrum bosses. Zoras in Zelda 1 may have been enemies but they were changed into their own species, so that can happen to any enemy, really.

truezelda,t3_af3rqj,The simple reason BotW takes place at the end of the timeline,"Unlike many theories floating around at the moment, it's not because they're trying to abandon the existing timeline...  The simple explanation is that it's just easier to make new events take place at the start or end of a timeline rather than to stick them in the middle of a series of events.

Let's look at how the Zelda series has developed from the start:

The Legend of Zelda.  First game.  Reference point for the next two games.

Adventure of Link.  Sequel to LoZ.  **End** of the Timeline.

A Link to the Past.  Prequel to LoZ.  **Start** of the timeline.

Link's Awakening.  Sequel to LttP.  Takes place in a dream world, without Zelda or Ganon.  Irrelevant to the timeline.

Ocarina of Time.  Prequel to LttP.  **Start** of the timeline.

Majora's Mask.  Sequel to OoT.  **End** of a split timeline (though also largely irrelevant, for the same reasons as LA).

Oracle of Ages and Seasons.  Even Nintendo's not entirely sure about these ones, though they're one of the few that take place in between existing events.

Four Swords.  Largely irrelevant, though placed at the **start** of the timeline at that point.

Wind Waker.  Sequel to OoT.  **End** of a split timeline.

Four Swords Adventures.  Sequel to FS, and takes place after TP.  **End** of a split timeline.

Minish Cap.  Prequel to FS.  **Start** of the timeline.

Twilight Princess.  Sequel to OoT.  Only instance where a console game was NOT at the start or end of a timeline when it was released.

Phantom Hourglass.  Sequel to WW.  **End** of a split timeline.

Spirit Tracks.  Sequel to WW and PH.  **End** of a split timeline.

Skyward Sword.  Prequel to OoT.  **Start** of the timeline, and incredibly hard to make a prequel to, given it sets up the conflict that repeats throughout the entire series (and the prequel story of Hylia/Demise would add nothing to the lore, since we already got all that from SS, anyway).

A Link Between Worlds.  Sequel to LttP.  Placed between existing events.

Triforce Heroes.  Utterly irrelevant to everything.  Placed between existing events.

Breath of the Wild.  **End** of a timeline.

So if we count all those up, that's 12 instances where the games have released as either the *earliest* or *latest* point in a timeline when they were released.  There are 5 instances where they've taken place between the events of other games (or 6 if we include OoA and OoS separately), and 2 of those are completely irrelevant to the timeline.  So what do we conclude?  It's much easier to make a game at the start or end of a timeline.  And since Skyward Sword is pretty hard to make a prequel to, the **end** of a timeline was *by far* the easiest place for them to stick BotW.",23,public,,0
truezelda,t3_af1sj6,Breath of the Wild isn't even real,"It's no secret the Zelda series has been creatively challenged since the creation of the timeline in 2011. If you've noticed, the vast majority of titles from that point have been ports or uninspired, such as A Link Between Worlds being a remake of A Link to the Past, and then a bunch of remasters. The mere fact that games are now established to exist in some sequence challenges what can be done; this wasn't the original intent when the original Legend of Zelda was developed.

Evidence for this exists in some of Nintendo's more recent publications on the series. For instance, Creating a Champion only details events leading up to Breath of the Wild. I believe it clearly shows that the developers are shifting focus to individual games and their mythos, with references in any game simply being an easter egg or implication that other titles exist as legends in the rest of the series.

What needs to be taken here is that the timeline was made to appease fans. That's not to downplay its importance among those interested, but it's all irrelevant at this point. It was made to sell a book - it's not referenced in game.

In-game references are just that: references. The timeline was made using these references to create our ""constellation"" of a timeline-mess. The developers specifically put these easter eggs and references in games as rewards to long time players.

The best evidence is behind the game's reason for development: to reset the series. Their intent was to build a story that not only *disconnected* from the rest of the series, but to clean slate all previous legends and start anew. Marvel does the same thing: cleanslating universes with resets, alternate dimensions, and reboots. Breath of the Wild is a ""Marvel reboot"" they do so often in comics - clear here that it's immensely difficult to write and maintain a series of interconnected stories that can stand on their own yet somehow all connect. Would even be harder to do in film or television. Impossible!

One way to look at it is our experiences playing games were just the myths and rumors of others. For example, *A Link to the Past* vaguely tells us of *Ocarina of Time's* story, sort of like the myths and legends of Norse mythology or Roman gods. We can accept and *choose* to believe these as ""canon"" in our world, but in reality I think most of us know these were made up.

Much of Breath of the Wild's world is frankensteined from other games: hills named after Wind Waker characters, the Temple of Time, Master Sword in the forest, etc. None of it fits cohesively together, which means the developers intended to tell all previous games were actually myth and legend like Roman gods, and deliberately took time to so subtly tell us this with in-game locations rather than form any sort of story.

Breath of the wild *does not* fit into any timeline because it was never meant to fit. It is intentionally deliberately by the developers a soft reset. This is exactly what they were thinking and determined to do throughout the course of development. The developer even said they will never place it in a timeline, that they never think about timelines when creating games, and that they wanted to create undo a lot of Skyward Sword's wrongs.

In all, it may be fun for fans to connect games, but get the bigger picture. It was not intended to be a massive series with branching timelines and interconnected games. What's clear here is that Breath of the Wild is a merging of these timelines, because it contains references to Phantom Hourglass, references Medli, Zelda mentions Twilight, and Kroroks and other various references show how all paths eventually lead to Breath of the Wild. It's either a merge or a soft reset that all paths lead to, pick one.

To close, the timeline was just made up folks. Randomly strewn together by easter eggs, doesn't even match what you hear *in game*. Instead, the in-game locations tell us all timelines eventually merge or become similar enough. They cleverly thought out this elaborate scenario because it's too challenged, creatively, to write sequels are games that can loosely but meaningfully be connected, like with some timeline.

All said, the timeline isn't real. It was made up to please fans.

being a timeline merge, Breath of the Wild isn't even real, And upon realizing this, my copy vanished into air,",20,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aeuwbh,All previous Zelda titles are merely myth and legend in the reality of BotW's world.,"A common trend among many Zelda enthusiasts is attempting to place BotW in the established canon of previous entries, namely in reference to the timeline. The reason why is understandable, it's a fun way to further explore the lore and try to piece things together.

However I believe Breath of the Wild does not neatly fit into any timeline theories because it was never meant to fit. It is meant to be canon only unto itself, and without outright casting off it's previous entries (like how Disney did with Star Wars EU). 

Many elements established previously within BotW's world are from other Zelda games, The Temple of Time, Zora's Domain, Kakariko Village, The Lost Woods, The Master Sword, etc. Huge chunks of lore lifted from other entries which establish them in the same world, I mean Hyrule is Hyrule. However I believe the connections BotW has to previous games is more mythological than historical.

Ocarina of Time is to Breath of the Wild what Arthurian Legend is to Great Britain. There was never a Camelot or King Arthur, but the legend and mythos is an undeniable part of the culture and history. It is known at some level that the struggle of the Hero vs. The Darkness is known in Hyrule as a cycle that repeats, it wouldn't then take much of a leap to assume some scholars during the glory-days of Hyrule (we always see it after it's downfall) would have pieced together various assumptions, myths, beliefs, and so on about the past, as well as presumably the future, which are all represented as the known Zelda continuity outside of BotW.

The real evidence for this is in the development intent behind the game. The developers never intended it to clearly fit within a certain timeline despite there being evidence for (and against) it's placement in a multitude of places. However this isn't because they don't respect the timeline, but rather because the original timeline is flawed and fragile. 

When Zelda games re-use an element from a previous game it''s meant to be a nod to the player, an easter egg, a throw-back, it's never meant as a deliberate inclusion to establish continuity. The timeline was developed after the games, it was not a closely guarded secret, but rather a fabrication created to connect the dots that were placed but never meant to form a picture. It is because of this that we have such a strange trident-shaped timeline and that it becomes harder for new Zelda games to really borrow and give nods to the elements from Zelda that the developers want without risking it violating some aspect of the timeline. 

This isn't a dismissal however of timelines and their importance to Zelda fans, rather I believe it is an intent by the developers to forge a new timeline using BotW as it's single foundation rather than the entirety of the established franchise timeline.

Evidence for this exists in the companion book **Creating a Champion** for BotW which has a very detailed timeline *solely* for the events leading up to the main story of Breath of the Wild, and it's very detailed and in-depth, far more than most Zelda games which use vague references to time and rarely mention actual time-frames like years. It shows that the devs are taking timelines more seriously and in all likelihood future entries in the series (at least from this dev team) will adhere to a more fleshed out continuity between them.

This would still allow for them to keep the timeline of the previous installments intact without risking breaking it with new entries, and give them the fullest extent of creative freedom for future installments. It also allows the other dev teams to still work within the previous timeline if they choose (like for a Link's Awakening remake/sequel for example). I am not trying to suggest BotW invalidates that timeline, but rather that within those Zelda games the timeline is real, within BotW however it is simply myth and conjecture, they are on two alternate continuities that will probably not cross.",90,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aev2jb,The curious case of the history of the Zelda Timeline and the Timeline Guide Books,"Hello everyone on this fine day in early January of the New Year. This thread is to some recent threads about the timeline that have popped up on this h ere sub, along with a follow up to an older post I made about Hyrule Historia many months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/8sgik1/a_deconstruction_of_hyrule_historia_anything/. My aim there was to expose some of the problems with that timeline guide book. 

The purpose of this post will be twofold: to show that the timeline is not something that was pulled out of Nintendo's backside in 2011 and to bring some further things to light regarding the two timeline guide books (the Hyrule Historia and the Zelda Encyclopedia). Without further ado, let's get started~

For starters, the timeline was not made according to some grand plan that was defined in 1986. It is a thing that was built up as every game was released, as many stories are built up like this, especially if they are created to be commercial. Examples include other Nintendo franchises or even something as famous as Lord of the Rings. This is a valid way to build a story or world and is not inherently better or worse than having a plan from the start.

We start with a little game for the NES called The Legend of Zelda (also known as The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda in Japan, interesting little fact) and it told a rather simple story. The next game, Zelda II: the Adventure of Link, was a direct sequel, said to take place ""many seasons later. Nothing really notable there. A Link to the Past is next and it is a prequel as indicated by two things. First the back of the box in Japanese says:

&gt; In this game, this stage is set far before Link started his adventures; a time when Hyrule was still united as one kingdom.

The Link referred to here is the one from the original two games and the ""united as one kingdom"" bit is a callback to the manual from Zelda II:

&gt; Long ago, when Hyrule was still one country, a great King was said to have used the Triforce to maintain order in Hyrule.

Furthermore, the Japanese manual of A Link to the Past features an origin story for Ganon and says:

&gt; ""Indeed, the King of Evil Ganon, the one who has threatened Hyrule so, was born at this time.""

According to the person who translated this text, this is a callback to the original games as well:

&gt; According to Zethar, the way this is written implies that the reader already knows who Ganon is. This is a reference to how ALttP is internally connected to LoZ and AoL.

Short interjection: I am using the Japanese here because the English versions, especially in older games, are often mistranslated as a result of this being the early years and some translators working for NoA not being well-versed in Japanese. Because of the mistranslations, things that are untrue or cause contradictions can pop up, which is why looking at the source text is necessary. The Japanese texts can be found in the source list at the end of this post.

Game 4: Link's Awakening. This one features a Link who had defeated Ganon according to its manual and the nightmares, the final bosses of the game, at one point take on the form of Ganon. This is specifically Ganon from A Link to the Past and even mimics one of the Demon King's attacks. These nightmares also take on the form of Agahnim and seem to be taking their forms based on Link's memories. This would put LA as a sequel to A Link to the Past.

Game 5: Ocarina of Time. This one is a bit difficult to discuss since it had a troubled development history and details of its plot apparently changed up until months before release. It was said in interviews that Ocarina is set during the backstory of A Link to the Past. There are three interviews about this. One is from Miyamoto but it is from 1997, almost a full year before the game released and the story was actively changing. The other two are from post release and from character designers and the script supervisor of the game. The interview with the supervisor is weird though, he says:

&gt; In this game there are 7 sages that appear and instruct Princess Zelda, but 6 of those appear in the Disk System game ""Adventure of Link"" as town names. We were hinting that the names of the sages in the era of the Imprisoning War spoken of in the Super Famicom Zelda game became town names in AoL. The events from that time became what we have today.

He says there are seven sages in the game that instruct princess Zelda and that they are all named after towns from Zelda II. This is not the case however: Zelda is counted as one of the seven in the final game and only five of the sages are named after towns (Saria, Darunia, Ruto, Nabooru and Rauru) while the other two are Zelda and Impa. The other two towns from Zelda II were called Kasuto (a name that never reappeared outside Zelda II) and Mido (whose name was given to the self-proclaimed leader of the Kokiri and not a sage). These errors are odd, considering the interviewee was the script supervisor of Ocarina. I can only conclude he is mistaken or he is talking about a development version of Ocarina, both of which question the validity of the interview and the statement about the Imprisoning War.

The third interview has nothing particularly wrong about it, but it is still said that Ocarina of Time is the Imprisoning War. This stands to contrast what would later be said in timeline guide books, where Ocarina is merely a prelude to the war and not the war itself. At any rate, things were a bit rocky around the time Ocarina released and this resulted in a lot of discrepancies between it and the backstory of A Link to the Past (which I have detailed in a separate document that can be found in the source list). Still, the game is set sometime before LTTP if only because of the prevalence of the Hylian people who are considered a mythical thing of the past by LTTP.

Game 6: Majora's Mask. This game is an explicit sequel to Ocarina of Time, set after one of two endings. This one is set after the child ending where Link came back to the past to warn about Ganondorf's plans. The other ending is the adult ending set in the timeline where Ganondorf ruled for seven years and was defeated. I will assume most people who read this and frequent this subreddit are familiar with the concept of the AT/CT split so I won't dwell too much on it. Only important thing to note is that the split basically makes the game's plot null as Link undoes the events of the Adult Timeline, or so it can be gleaned at the time. Wind Waker was not out yet, after all.

Game 7: the Oracles. These two are a bit vague, more vague than the games that came before at any rate. They are most of the time placed somewhere around the era of A Link to the Past or Link's Awakening (either between the two or long after the latter) since Link is shown leaving on a boat almost identical to the one at start of Link's Awakening. The young witch Maple is also introduced in the game and was retroactively added to the GBA remake of A Link to the Past as the assistant of the witch Syrup. For now, let's put it somewhere around the LTTP era and move on.

Game 8: Four Swords. This one came with the GBA remake of A Link to the Past and connected to literally nothing at the time of release. Moving on.

Game 9: The Wind Waker. This game gives relevance to the adult era of Ocarina of Time, being explicitely set many years after. Ganondorf was defeated by the Hero of Time (aka Ocarina's Link), returned at some point, was sealed under the sea, tries to get back during this game and is killed. The important thing here is that the game ends with Link, Tetra and Tetra's pirates setting out to find a new land to call home.

Game 10: Four Swords Adventures. This one is explicitely a sequel to Four Swords as said in the manual and intro (with the same Link and Zelda) and is believed by some to be connected to A Link to the Past and its backstory, which is a topic for another day but I wanted to note it here nonetheless for the sake of completeness.

Game 11: The Minish Cap. This one is a distant prequel to Four Swords and Four Swords Adventures, as it details the origins of two of the central plot elements in the other Four Swords games: the Four Sword and the Wind Mage Vaati. There is now a trilogy of Four Swords games.

Game 12: Twilight Princess. This one is once again a bit vague, although allusions are made to Ocarina of Time. The backstory features a Ganondorf who was unsucceful in conquering Hyrule and was to be put to death for his crimes. This seems like a natural outflow of the child ending of Ocarina, where Link warned about the future of the adult era. A lone photo of a fisherman from Ocarina also appears in the game, suggesting close temporal proximity to Ocarina. Twilight would go many years after both Ocarina and Majora's Mask thusly.

Game 13 and game 14: Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. These are both explicit continuations of the story in The Wind Waker. Phantom Hourglass is a direct sequel and Spirit Tracks is set 100 years after the founding of a new land by Tetra and Link (the same one they set out to find in The Wind Waker).

Game 15: Skyward Sword. This one is set in a very distant past, before anything else. It is set before the founding of Hyrule and features the creation of the Master Sword, which is a plot central item in many other games (A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker and Twilight Princess so far). The game also features the reason as to why Ganondorf and his demons return so many times, a fact stated by Demise, main bad guy of Skyward: a curse of the Demon Tribe follows both Link and Zelda for eons. This is mostly a game about origins and beginnings, set at the very start of it all.

Game 16: A Link Between Worlds. This one is set ages after A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, having a map almost identical to that of the former. The game also ends with the Triforce in the hands of the royal family of Hyrule and in the credits a painting can be seen with the Triforce shining over the land, which seems like a setup for the golden age of the Triforce-using monarchy mentioned in Zelda II. This game thus acts as a bit of a further connecting factor between the era of A Link to the Past and the NES games.

Game 17: Tri Force Heroes. This one is another case of the Four Swords, as in, it connects to literally nothing. With some imagination it can be put in certain spots of the timeline but that is still pretty flimsy. Maybe future games will give it more context like what happened with Four Swords, but for now it has none.

Game 18: Breath of the Wild. This one is particularly controversial with its timeline placement, as indicated by the fact that there has been a constant dialogue about it for more than 2 years at this point. It is obvious that this is set at the end of a timeline where ""The Beast Ganon"" (not simply Ganondorf) was especially prevalent and the Master Sword was readily acessible. For the rest there is not a lot more detail to go into here since the timeline placement of Breath has already been extensively discussed previously. And so to conclude we have now a few chains and some loose games that end up like this:

SS -&gt; OoT -&gt; TWW -&gt; PH -&gt; ST

SS -&gt; OoT -&gt; MM -&gt; TP

OoT ----&gt; LTTP -&gt; LA - (Oracles floating around here somewhere) -&gt; ALBW -&gt; Zelda 1 -&gt; Zelda 2

TMC -&gt; FS -&gt; FSA

TFH (little connection to anything else)

BotW (somewhere at the end)

Now these can be connected and that has happened; I have my own opinions about that and I will share them if there is interest in a follow-up post. For now, this is more or less the status quo.

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I would like to turn to the timeline guide books: Hyrule Historia and Zelda Encyclopedia. I already did an examination of the former in my previous post so if you want my thoughts on that, give it a (re-)read I suppose. I also mostly avoided interviews or so-called ""Word of God"" in the timeline rundown above because it is often contradictory with itself or other interviews. There could be all kinds of reasons for that from making mistakes, to not giving a crap, to not knowing something on the spot, to outright lying. Maybe even a mix of those. Point is, it is often unreliable in the case of the Zelda series as I demonstrated a bit above and could be delved deeper into if one so desires.

The timeline guide books are, of course, another form of this Word of God, but are they really? If you read my previous post you would know the books were not primarily written by the Zelda team but instead outsourced to a third party. Since making the post, I have come across a few more facts about the books that may pique interest.

There are, to start, some notable mistakes I noticed while reading Zelda Encyclopedia in full:

-saying that the Triforce rested in the Sacred Realm during the Triforce conflicts while in A Link Between Worlds it is said that it was kept in Hyrule itself (page 23).

-saying there are Seven Lokomo Sages in Spirit Tracks while only six appear (Byrne is a seventh Lokomo but he defected to the Demon King before actually becoming a sage and is a bad guy for most of the game) (page 23)

-saying that the emblem of New Hyrule was inspired by the King of Red Lions while it was modelled after the bow of Tetra's ship instead (page 40).

-saying that the Gerudo Token in Ocarina of Time is neccessary to enter Gerudo Valley while that can be accessed from the start of the adult era. Instead, the token grants access to the Haunted Wasteland (page 45).

Some of these are rather minor but it still shows a lack of research on the part of the ones who wrote the book. The most interesting thing that I noticed in Zelda Encyclopedia was page number 215, which contains a whole bibliography for the book. Said bibliography consists almost solely of Japanese guide books with at the end saying ""each instruction manual and official homepage."" It would seem thus that the Encyclopedia is mostly Japanese guides while the manuals of the games are only mentioned in passing. Furthermore, the games themselves are wholly absent in the bibliography while there do exist citation rules for games:  https://style.mla.org/citing-a-video-game/. Why the games are absent is not clear: perhaps they were not considered for the book (which would be worrysome for the canonicity) or they are not listed because it is assumed from the start the book is based on the games (which is still somewhat unprofessional as why would you bother to include a bibliography if you don't include everything you cited). Either way, this is very eyebrow raising in my eyes, especially since guides oftentimes contain errors as pointed out by the members of this subreddit. Perhaps the guides are the sources of the mistakes, and who is to say the Historia was not also based on such guides? It was written by the same people and does not include a bibliography of its own.

Now, I am not done with the bibiliography quite yet. It is also present in the Japanese version of the Encyclopedia (albeit in a different location) and lists Japanese works; this is not something that was added by the translators. The bibiliography is also located at the end of section 2 of the Encyclopedia, after which another sections begins. This would suggest the bibliography is for section 2 only, but section 3 has its own source listings for interviews and section 2 is a database of enemies, locations, etc. Then one thing in the bibliography stands out:

&gt; Nintendo Official Guidebook: Hyrule Historia - The Legend of Zelda Complete Works (Shogakukan)

The Historia itself was thusly included in the bibiliography, with the implication being that it is part of a series of guides. This series is the ""Nintendo Official Guidebook"", so should the other books in this series be viewed as canon as well? Books of the series listed in the bibliography are ordinary game guides like ""Nintendo Official Guidebook - The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"", ""Nintendo Official Guidebook - The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes"", ""Nintendo Official Guidebook - The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D"" and so on. Are these canon as well?

I also cannot imagine how the Historia would serve as a source for the database section since it only lists concept art and its own timeline section. I can only conclude the Historia was used as a basis for section 1: the historical records that contains most of the lore in the book. I thus find it highly likely this bibliography is for both section 1 and section 2, although mostly for the latter.

Of course, inaccurate guides are not unique to Zelda and I know at least the Fire Emblem series and the Metroid series have similar books and guides that are as prone to error as the ones for the Zelda series. The pattern I noticed as I delved into other series of Nintendo these years was clear: the books are often inaccurate and not handled by people who actually worked on the games.

My point with all that is, is that the timeline does exist to some capacity but that the one in Hyrule Historia is not it. The timeline as concept has existed for decades while the Historia timeline was thought up in 2011 and the Encyclopedia timeline is a modification of the Historia timeline thought up in 2017. This can also be gleaned from the whole Ocarina of Time/A Link to the Past connection with the Downfall Timeline. This post is already quite long as is so I can explain that in a follow-up if desired where I would explain my own views on the timeline. Thanks for your attention and have a good day.

truezelda,t3_aenscw,"The Great Plateau is Skyloft, but why does nobody seem to notice?","I never see anyone talking about this, but I can't help but feel that I must not be the only one who noticed.  Yet, this has important relevance to many theories regarding the history of BotW, and it continues to go unacknowledged, to my eye.  So, I figured I'd finally make a thread on it, to discuss.  I've heard it expressed that this is not obvious at first glance, so I will try to direct your eye appropriately, including some landmarks.

&amp;#x200B;

To begin, you must imagine that Skyloft, as illustrated in SS, was not at its true scale--only that which the hardware of the Wii warranted--and so the Switch has provided a grander scale on which to represent Skyloft.  The heights are higher, the widths are wider, the style is more realistic and defined, and what was once hovering in the sky has now come to rest in roughly the same configuration as when it hovered in the air.

Additionally, it's important to note that you have to rotate one of the maps in your mind about 90 degrees (either that of the Great Plateau in BotW, or Skyloft in SS), in order to align the following landmarks, and it helps if you examine and confirm in-game:

* In BotW, Mount Hylia (where you find the old man peering out over Hyrule and he gives you a sweater, in the beginning) is the tallest mountain of mainland Skyloft, below the hovering upper lake which features a waterfall that is the source of water, however, in BotW we see that the upper lake has come to rest on the shoulders of Mount Hylia, below where it once hovered (yet, still springing forth water to fall into the main body of water, now called the River of the Dead).
* The River of the Dead also continues to flow and fall over the edge, like it always has since the days of SS, except it used to also flow over the opposite side of mainland Skyloft (closer to the temple), and in BotW we find a gateway with some peppers growing nearby that used to be the path of that second waterfall, when the water level was higher.
* The Shrine of Resurrection in BotW is underground, roughly below where the Bazaar once stood.
* The Temple of Time has been rebuilt roughly above where the temple descended at the end of SS, now also featuring a Statue of the Goddess and facing a different direction.
* The Forest of Spirits appears to be where the Knights Academy of Skyloft came to rest, judging by the similar location and the contours at its outward-facing, cliffside edge in both games.

I could point out more features, but I think this is enough to reveal the evident similarities.  If anyone has an ability to easily rotate the maps of SS and BotW in alignment and post a side-by-side comparison (maybe even flagging these features with a color code), I'd appreciate it--but no worries, if not.

Does anyone disagree with this?  Is this a new idea that supports or alters your theories?  It is not revealed when Skyloft descended, or mow many times it has been abandoned and civilized since, so is anyone curious as to when the rest of Skyloft came down?  What knowledge might have been brought down with Skyloft, and did they reunite with a separate, flourishing Hylian society upon their descent?",94,public,,0
truezelda,t3_af5evj,"Majora's Mask is an Amazing Game, but It's So Incredibly Overhyped and Inferior to Ocarina in Many","I think Majora's Mask is an incredible game, but it really seems to have this hipster following in the Zelda fanbase that lauds it as the ultimate Zelda, and the superior game to Ocarina of Time, even though Ocairna gets all the glory from ""nostlagia"" or something.

My biggest problem with Majora's Mask is how disjointed and tacked on much of the world feels. In Ocarina of time the entire overworld seemed organic and flowed together. It seemed like a totally believable fantasy overworld. You have the Zoar fountain, which flows into soras domain, which flows into the Zora river. The Zora river then flows into hyrule field, through the moat of the castle, then behid the mountains. It comes back through Gerudo Valley and empties into lake hylia.

Majora's Mask has nothing like that.Each segment of the overworld is clearly just a themed area with assets from Ocarina applied in some sort of context. Think about the Great Bay. It's a beach with some water, and some things to do strewn about. Very little consideration is taken regarding the thematic placement of structures, or NPCs, or scenerary, and it's the same way with every area. Sure, as a game, everything is well designed and fun and intuitive, but it totally lacks in so many aspects.

Like Death Mountain for example, that's a great example of a 3D creating a feeling of going up. Like you're on this adventure scaling the really formidable mountain. Snowhead doens't feel like that. You just have a few areas that have obstacles and NPCs.

Same things with the Temples. When you think of something like Ocarina. Which has the Forest Temple, it's clearly some sort of decrepit mansion. When you explore it, there's a courtyard, there's sewers, there's balconies, the boss room is some sort of gallery.

Now think of snowhead. What the fuck is it? It's just a big cavern with puzzles and obstacles in it. Even Stone Tower, which is an amazing dungeon, has this issue. It's this stone palace or temple with obstacle rooms. There's no rhyme or reason.

And also, the fanfiction theories are the worst. The reason this game has no specificity regarding Majora or the world of termina isn't because the game is Dark and shrouded in Mystery, it's because the devlopers just wanted to focus on the gameplay and not a bunch of lore theyput extremely subtle hints in. Majora's mask is not nearly as deep as its following makes it out to be. It has some mature themes and dark aspects, but Majora is just a one time demon in a mask, and stone tower is just a creepy tower, that the developers wanted to make reminiscent of the tower of Babel.

Again, Majora's Mask is an amazing game. There's plenty of amazing thematic aspects regarding sidequests, but the thematic aspects of the overowlrd and the dungeons and quests and NPCs are so inorgnanic unimmersive sometimes. I don't think OoT or MM are necessarily better than one another as its obviously up to opinion, but there's really significant reasons to prefer Ocarina of Time. Majora's Mask is not some definitively better gem, and personally, I think Ocarina is 100x better than MM but that's just me.",0,public,,0
truezelda,t3_aerczv,Smash Bros. Is Not a Valid Source for Saying Redeads are Made of Clay,"Smash Bros. is just not a valid source for any info on games outside of the Smash Bros series. I hear people say that redeads are made of clay because that's what the Smash Bros. trophy says, but that's just not a viabe source. Smash Bros. also got Ganondorf wrong. One of the Goddesses suggests that while Link is a different person in each incarnation, Ganondorf is the same person reborn over and over again. This is wrong. First of all, Ganondorf was reincarnated once in the entire timeline, and that one time he was actually a different person. So Smash Bros. is just not a viable source of Zelda information.

Second, the Redeads are obviously just reanimated dead people. They're places associated with death all the time. Found in graves, found in dark temples. Also, they're found in the bottom of the well, a place Ganondorf actually would not have been able to ever access since before Link etered the entrance was submerged in water.

So Smash Bros. was likely just trying to make the prospect of redeads, which are reanimated dead people, more kid-friendly by saying they're made of clay.

All Ganondorf says is he ""coveted that wind, I suppose""

He just was jealous of Hyrule, and wanted to rule it, either to enjoy its prosperous nature, or destroy it out of spite.

truezelda,t3_aemrgq,A question for you all and a discussion about the Minish,"Here is the question. If you want to just read this part, answer in the comments, and move on, that's fine. I added on a discussion on the Minish because I feel these two topics connect anyway. 

So, many feel that, as of Breath of the Wild, Nintendo has decided on and established who the constant races will be in games going forward. This is a bit of a leap after just one game, so why do so many people think this? Well, for one, many felt Breath of the Wild was a sort of reboot of the series. It fundamentally changed what had previously been the winning formula for these games, went back to a Zelda 1 style of progression, and set up a Hyrule that many feel has much to be discovered still. Also, these six races have all been present from very early on in the series. Hylians from the first game onward, Zora (in some form) from the first game onward, Koroks (as Kokiri), Gorons, Zora (new form), Gerudo, and Sheikah from Ocarina of Time onward, and the Rito...don't really fit this at first. However, it's very clear from the carvings in Twilight Princess HD that Nintendo wants to establish the Rito as a long-existing race like all the others at this point.

The question is: If these six are truly the races Nintendo wants to use going forward, and you got to decide a seventh race to fit alongside them from all the other pre-existing races, which would you choose and why? What are the positives and negatives of that choice?

Now there are a lot to choose from, and many have only ever appeared in one game before, so there are a lot of options here. I personally would choose the Minish.

&amp;#x200B;

But why? Well, the Minish, while only being present in one game in the past, got the whole focus of that game to themselves. That's more than can be said for any other race other than the Twili. They also are set up in that game to basically exist in every single other Zelda game due to two key attributes of their race. First, they are so small that they can't be seen by the naked eye (and only by good children at that) and second, they are the ones who place all the goodies in tall grass and under rocks. These two things have essentially tied them into the series lore better than probably any other race (even the main six featured in Breath of the Wild). This guarantees that, if there's a Zelda game that lets you find rupees and stuff by cutting grass, the Minish are there somewhere. It's also worth noting that the Minish were originally planned to be in Breath of the Wild alongside all the others, meaning by far they have the largest chance of being raised to main race status in the future.

Now, there are also two main negatives however that must be considered. For one, any game involving the Minish would probably have to include some way for Link to shrink down to their size. That can become difficult to justify from game to game, and eventually wear itself out. Next, the lore established in The Minish Cap states that they only surface every 100 years due to a special door opening then. If the Minish became a constant race across the series, each game would have to be set 100 years apart.

I'd like to address these and offer solutions. For the first one, who says Link must shrink to their size to speak to them? The concept art they showed for the Minish in Breath of the Wild had the Minish much larger than they previously were, and displayed Link crouching down to talk to one. They are still tiny, but they are visible to someone Link's size. If the Minish were made just that little bit larger, then shrinking would not be required all the time. Alternatively, if future Zelda games are direct sequels to Breath of the Wild, then keeping the Minish as small as they were in their debut game and establishing a shrinking mechanic early on would then mean that any future games would not have to bend over backwards to create a reason and way to shrink Link down, because it would already be established previously. 

As for the second point, all this would require is a minor retcon. It's not like the races haven't been retconned before. The enemy Zora started off as a race that couldn't coexist with the peaceful Zora, but Oracle of Ages later made them coexist as River and Sea Zora respectively. A similar thing happened with the Zora and Rito. Or the Gerudo getting a massive lore buff in BoTW and becoming much taller than the average Hylian. So what am I suggesting for the Minish? Well, just make it so the door opening up every 100 years doesn't let the Minish through to our world, but rather makes them visible to the naked eye. After all, this makes more sense than what TMC previously said. If the Minish can only enter our world every 100 years, then how do they perform their duties in all other Zelda games? How do some of the Minish have such established villages and relationships with Hylians if they can only do it once every 100 years? And it wouldn't even have to be a retcon really, just say the Hylians got this detail about the Minish wrong just like they thought they were called Picori originally. 

Anyway, this is my pitch for bringing the Minish to the series consistently, but I'd love to hear your pitch for a race you want to see return.",9,public,,0

truezelda,t3_ae6eh3,The Spider's Curse,"What do the cursed Great Deku Tree, and the cursed rich family, from OoT have in common?

Well, both curses may have been inspired by Kodoku.

**Curse on The Great Deku Tree**

The Great Deku Tree tells Link:

&gt;Now...listen carefully... A wicked man of the desert cast this dreadful curse upon me... 

&gt;Though your valiant efforts to break the curse were successful, I was doomed before you started... Yes, I will pass away soon... But do not grieve for me...

Ganondorf's curse turns out to be a massive parasite growing, and breeding, within the heart of the GDT, the Parasitic Armored Arachnid: Gohma. Basically, she's a giant bug. This curse is fatal for the GDT.

**Kakariko's Cursed Rich Family**

In Kakariko Village (OoT) there once lived a very rich family. They were so rich that their wealth was known even in Zora's Domain. 

&gt;""You say you want to buy a Zora Tunic? That tunic is made of the finest material, and is therefore exceedingly expensive! In fact, **I'm afraid only that very rich family in Kakariko Village can afford this fine garment...**"" ‚Äî Zora

But, one day the family was cursed.

&gt;""Folks around here tell of a fabulously rich family that once lived in one of the houses in this village... **But they say that the entire family was cursed due to their greed! Who knows what might happen to those who are consumed by greed...**"" ‚Äî Old man in Kakariko Village 

The old man in Kakariko Village says that the curse was connected to their greed, that perhaps they were consumed by their greed.

The house where the rich family lived still stands in Kakariko Village, and the cursed family members can still be found inside it - the father and his five sons. But, they're not exactly human anymore...

In fact, they have been transformed into giant spiders, monsters called Skulltula, and their home is now known as the House of Skulltula. 

Why did the curse transform them into Skulltula?

When Link enters the House of Skulltula, the Cursed Rich Man tells him:

&gt;**We all look like this because of the spider's curse**. If every **Spider of the Curse** in the entire world were destroyed, the curse would be broken.

Notice that he says they transformed ""because of the spider's curse."" Breaking the curse involves destroying every Spider of the Curse. Spiders of the Curse are also called Gold Skulltulas, named for their colouring, which is also the symbol of wealth and greed.

So, just like the curse on the GDT, this curse also involves bugs.

Remember, though, that the old man told us that the rich family was cursed due to their greed, that it consumed them.

**Other Curses on Greed in Zelda**

Curses are not uncommon in the Zelda mythos, and neither are curses connected to greed. In TP, a man named Jovani is in a similar situation:

&gt;I'm Jovani. I...became **consumed by greed** long ago, and **sold my soul to a dark creature that did this to me**... I think **if you can free the pieces of my soul from the ghosts that hold them, I'll be free**...

In this case, Jovani was transformed into a gold statue instead of a Skulltula, and his curse was caused by ""a dark creature"" who divided his soul among a number of Poes. These ghosts must be killed to remove the curse, in contrast to the Spiders of the Curse for the rich family of Kakariko Village. 

So, no bugs involved here.

In BotW, Link can pray to the Horned Statue found in Hateno Village.

&gt;Ahhh... So there are some who still pay me homage. [You can talk?!] You don't say... You can hear my voice? [Yes.] Now, that is a surprise. What were you praying for? Long life? **Wealth, like so many of your kind?** Whichever it was, you came to the right place.

However, the Horned Statue is a liar. He steals the life and power from people, and only returns them for a price.

&gt;Fa ha ha... My touch is as subtle as ever... **Note how I took that essence from you without leaving a mark**.

&gt;What's wrong, then? Have your prayers gone unanswered? [Give it back.] Fa ha ha... Did you think I'd deceived you? Perish the thought. I hope that ours will be a long and profitable relationship. So which will it be? As I may have mentioned once or twice, I'm a dealing in life and power. I can provide a valuable service to you. I take Heart Containers or Stamina Vessels from you...and then, **for a price, return whichever of the two you like**.

It's ironic that his greed caused him to be transformed into a statue by the Goddess Hylia. 

But, again there's no connection between the curse and bugs.

In MM, there are actually two Spider Houses in Termina. They have their own mysteries, and the circumstances of the curse are different to their Hyrulean counterpart. For instance, why are portraits of Skull Kid found in the house by Great Bay Coast, and why did Captain Keeta of Ikana Kingdom send some soldiers to investigate that house? These are questions for another discussion. Perhaps the differences come from Termina being a strange twisted parallel of Hyrule. For the purposes of this post, the important thing to note is that the Spiders of the Curse in MM are still connected to greed.

**Kodoku Magic**

So, going back to OoT, and the cursed rich family from Kakariko Village, why is greed connected to the curse of a spider? And, what connection could it have with the fatal curse, placed by the evil sorcerer Ganondorf, on the GDT?

The answer to this may be found in Japanese folklore. [Kodoku](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodoku) is a type of poisonous magic used to curse people. 

&gt;To create kodoku, sorcerers would mix several insects in a jar, and let them kill one another until only one survived. The fluids of the insect that survived would be used to poison an individual with a curse that would control them, **cause them misfortune, or kill them**.

&gt;The term ""kodoku"" can **also be applied to the spirit which is the incarnation of this particular magic** (which usually appears in the shape of a worm or other animal).

So, this curse connected to bugs, can cause the victim misfortune, or kill them. It can also incarnate as a spirit in the shape of the bug.

How is this type of curse connected to greed?

&gt;The **remaining insect could also be used as a sort of ""luck charm"" granting the one who performed the ritual great wealth**. In return the owner is supposed to feed the bug.

However, there were consequences for not feeding the bug, and making it angry.

&gt;Neglecting to do so would enrage the insect, **if the owner does not equivalently repay the insect by placing all his or her riches beside a road, plus interest in gold and silver, the insect would devour the home owner**.

It's interesting to note that the curse could be passed on to someone else by giving them the great wealth granted by the bug.

&gt;Therefore, **this ritual could also be used as a death curse by giving the riches to an ignorant individual**.

Would the developers of OoT have been familiar with this type of curse from Japanese folklore? Yes, kodoku is featured in many parts of their popular culture, including novels, manga, and anime.

Does the kodoku curse correspond exactly to Queen Gohma, or the Curse of the Spider, in Ocarina of Time? No, of course not. For instance, there are one hundred Gold Skulltula maintaining the curse on the rich family, not one as is traditional for kodoku.

However, in choosing to link a fatal curse to a bug, and another curse on greed to a bug, the developers may well have had in mind kodoku. 

There are so many connections between the Zelda mythos, and Japanese mythology and folklore. Some are large, and some are small. Some references are very explicit, while others, like this example, may have just been a source of inspiration.",110,public,,0

truezelda,t3_adnjez,Why Vah Rudania is a Salamander,"I would like to preface this by apologizing if this has been discussed before and I want to say that this was originally posted in r/zelda, but I thought you guys and gals would find this interesting.

There‚Äôs so much I love about Breath of the Wild, but one of my absolute favorite things in the game are the four Divine Beasts. Each Divine Beast is a hulking machine in the shape of an animal that seemingly fits with the region and culture that it inhabits, except for one of the four. Vah Medoh is a large bird-like structure that soars above the home of the Rito, a group of humanoid bird creatures. Vah Naboris resembles a large camel that roams the desert and sandy dunes that the Gerudo tribe calls home. While not explicitly water-dwelling creatures, elephants are quite famous for sucking up and shooting water from their trunks; which is why Vah Ruta‚Äôs elephant design still seems fitting for the fish-like Zora and their Domain (even though I would argue that Vah Ruta having a more whale or catfish-esque design like Lord Jabu-Jabu would make more sense, since Jabu-Jabu is linked with the Zora and Vah Ruta having a whale-like design would still allow Vah Ruta to retain the dungeon mechanic of  spraying water at different angles through the use of a blowhole, but I digress). The three designs of these Divine Beasts all make sense for their regions; birds are synonymous with the sky and air, camels are synonymous with arid climates, and connections can be made between elephants and water. 

Why then does Vah Rudania, the Divine Beast that resides on the volcanic Death Mountain, resemble a salamander? Well, I believe this is rooted in an ancient misconception of salamanders. One of the earliest accounts of salamanders dates back to around 200-500 CE in the Judaic text of the Talmud. In the Talmud, it is said that salamanders are born from fire, with a medieval French rabbi and prominent commentator on the Talmud named Rashi elaborating that a salamander is born from a fire that has been burning in the same spot for 7 years. The text of the Talmud also stated that the blood of a salamander could grant someone immunity to extreme heats, an idea possibly originating from Pliny the Elder, a Roman who believed a salamander‚Äôs body is so cold that it could extinguish a flame. As Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamanders_in_folklore_and_legend points out, the belief that salamanders are born of fire may have been started by a tendency that many species of salamanders exhibit; the propensity to hibernate in logs. When someone would unknowingly bring home some logs that contained hibernating salamanders and then burn the logs for warmth, the salamanders inside would crawl out of the burning logs; making it look as if the salamanders came from the fire itself. 

However, the link between salamanders and fire would be made even more interesting by the 16th century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus. In his work entitled ‚ÄúLiber de Nymphis, sylphis, pygmaeis et salamandris et de caeteris spiritibus‚Äù, Paracelsus described four human-like beings that both inhabit and are embodiments of the four elements of Antiquity. These creatures have become known as the Elementals. According to Paracelsus, the Elemental of Earth is the Pygmy (later known as the Gnome), the Elemental of Air is the Sylph (typically what people conceptualize as a fairy), the Elemental of Water is the Undine (later known as the Water Nymph), and the Elemental of Fire is the Salamander. The links between fire and salamanders have even seeped into modern pop culture, with possibly the most famous example being the Pok√©mon Charmander (whose name is a portmanteau of charred and salamander). People in my original post have even suggested that Dodongos may be based on the myth of the Fire Salamander and that Vah Rudania is supposed to be a Dodongo. 

These are the reasons why I believe that the Divine Beast of the Gorons is a large salamander. If you have made it this far, thank you so much for checking out my post.",91,public,,0
truezelda,t3_adhptt,Ox-Head and Horse-Face,"Here's just a small reference that I found interesting. 

[Ox-Head and Horse-Face](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox-Head_and_Horse-Face) are two guardians, or types of guardians, of the Underworld in Chinese and Japanese mythology. According to the wiki, ""they are the first beings a dead soul encounters upon entering the Underworld; in many stories they directly escort the newly dead to the Underworld."" Also, ""in Japanese mythology, Ox-Head and Horse-Face are known as ""Gozu"" and ""Mezu"" respectively.""

Horse-Face immediately reminded me of [this guy](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/3/31/TAoL_Horsehead_Sprite.png?version=f67df70af05a6308e27fa95ee30e8b75) from *The Adventure of Link*. He's the boss of the first dungeon, Parapa Temple (the Palaces are called Temples in the Japanese version), and he was known as either Horsehead or [Mazura](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Mazura). These names were never provided in-game, instead they came from officially licensed products, such as guides, and translations by NoA. The *Arts &amp; Artifacts* book lists its name is Mazura, so I guess that's official for now.

Mazura in Japanese is „Éû„Ç∫„É©, and the Zelda Wiki translates that as Horse Face.

So far it seems like the mythology is lining up with the game. The first boss has a horse's face just like one of the first guardians of the Underworld. But, can we find Ox-Head in the game, and find further evidence of a connection?

Unlike Horse-Face, no enemy from AoL immediately springs to mind as a reference to Ox-Head. However, his name in Japanese is Gozu, and one of the bosses is called [Gooma](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/d/db/TAoL_Gooma_Attacking_Sprite.png?version=ad0abfbabfcaa5b2ec7976cac142c5b0). He does have a spiked helmet, but that's not exactly an Ox-Head. But, looking at its [Zelda wiki entry](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Gooma) reveals this [official artwork](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/e/ef/TAoL_Gooma_Artwork.png?version=aa7a141eafbf7d68e47e02248925eddc). Bingo! That's an Ox-Head. 

But there's a twist. Gooma was never in the Japanese version of AoL released on the Famicom. It was created for the English version on the NES. The original boss of the fifth dungeon, Sea Temple (Palace on the Sea), is [Jermafenser](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Jermafenser) in the Famicom version. It's also the boss of the second dungeon in both versions. However, the artwork used for Gooma actually belongs to a different enemy in the Japanese version. [Guma](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Guma) is an enemy found in a number of the dungeons. Guma sounds very similar to Gooma, and if you look at it's [in-game sprite](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/c/c2/TAoL_Guma_Sprite.png?version=93c417f9959381b2bb5a568adf661c80), you can make out the horns on its head. It also uses a ball and chain weapon, just as depicted in the artwork. 

As mentioned, Guma appears in a number of dungeons, including the first one with Mazura. It also appears in the fifth dungeon, which has Gooma in the NES version. Another change made in the fifth dungeon, from the Japanese to the English version, is that Mazura was replaced with an Iron Knuckles for its mini-boss. So, that makes two dungeons in the Famicom version with both Ox-Head and Horse-Face. 

I think it's pretty cool to see this reference to these guardians of the Underworld in *The Adventure of Link*.

Lastly, there's another enemy in the dungeons of AoL called [Doomknocker](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Doomknocker). His Japanese name is „Éò„É´„Ç∞„Éº„Éû, and translates as Hell Guma.",45,public,,0
truezelda,t3_adfi7x,I‚Äôve spent 3 hours researching and building the strongest composite Link. Here‚Äôs what I got,"The Strongest Composite Link Build

Link from the Legend of Zelda becomes pretty busted as a composite forms. Say Link gets all of his stats, feats, gear from every canon games; this makes an pretty unbeatable opponent unless you have a God/Omnipotent who can just erase reality. 

Let‚Äôs take a look at the Hero of Hyrule in a composite form.

First we‚Äôll start with the weakest Link, The Hero of Trains from Spirit Tracks. He fights and defeats Malladus, the evil protagonist who isnt strong enough to alert the Goddesses, need a special sword to be defeated or even posses a piece of the triforce. Malladus claims that he can destroy the world before he goes. This puts Malladus on a planetary level, and ST Link on a smaller planetary level who is able to defeat him with the help of Zelda.

Now let‚Äôs look at the Hero of Time. His adventures in Ocarina of Time and Majoras mast prove that he‚Äôs above Planetary by these accounts thanks to events that other Links proved by fighting this same Ganondorf in other games such as Wind Waker. 

Ganondorf - Before obtaining the triforce of power, Ganondorf was able to kill the great deku tree; one of the wisest beings in Hyrule. He could control Gohma, King Dodongo, Brinra, and nearly killed the Zora Deity Great Jabu Jabu. After possession of the Triforce of Power and defeated by the hero of time. In wind waker he was able to break the seal of the Seven Sages and could only have been stopped by the King of Hyrule using the Triforce. The Triforce then flooded all of Hyrule, and stopped time; which in turn failed to stop Ganondorf from resurfacing. Not even the Triforce, the holy grail one shot of Nintendo that was created by the literal goddesses couldn‚Äôt stop him. Ganondorf then stopped the rotation of the entire planet and moon causing an endless night of hell. This would put Ganondorf at small dwarf star level. This is the same Ganondorf that the Hero of Time stabs in the face with the master sword to finish him off and kill him. This puts the Hero of Time around dwarf star level, maybe DSL+. 

Majora - a demon who wasn‚Äôt a major threat to be noticed by the Golden Goddesses, needed a special weapon to be defeated as you can defeat him with the Kokiri Sword, nor does Majora posses any piece of the triforce. And was able to summon the moon in his BASE form, which confirms that if the moon wasn‚Äôt stopped it would destroy the world. This proves that Link as a child (roughly 9 years old) is able to defeat Majora at full power with the kokiri sword, making him more evident that he‚Äôs Dwarf Star Level +. 

Mind you, Ganondorf is able to defeat The Hero of Time, who wields the blade of evils bane and the Triforce of courage along with Zelda‚Äôs help who holds the Triforce of wisdom, as proven in the fallen hero timeline. Only to be further defeated by another reincarnation putting them at the same level/ higher than the Hero of Time.  The Hero of Time is also able to dodge Beamos attacks which are stated to be as fast as light, making Links reaction as fast as the speed of light. 

Next we move to the strongest Link, Skyward Sword Link. 

SS Link was able to defeat somebody stronger than Ganondorf; Demise; who is the original evil demon God from Zeldaverse hell who‚Äôs spirit takes reincarnation as Ganondorf. Demise is more powerful than the Goddess Hylia as he is able to create a curse that affects the blood of Hylia, and the chosen hero. This is the curse that allows him to reincarnate as Ganon and cause havoc to Hylia and the Hero. Demise has also been shown in SS to overpower Hylia with possession and draining her soul after she takes over Zelda‚Äôs body. Hylia is stronger than any Zelda ever, including the Zelda that sealed Ganon in OOT and Zelda that sealed Calamity Ganon (who is proven to be the strongest Ganon due to giving up reincarnation and pursuing his pure enraged form-although weaker to demise because Zelda was able to contain Calamity herself. Demise&gt;Hylia&gt;Zelda&gt;Calamity) in BoTW. Demise also has been shown to create his own universe and dimension just to have a 1 on 1 battle with Link. This puts Demise at Large Star Level feats. Link, with a one on one battle without Zelda, is able to defeat this Demise. Skyward Sword Link also possessed the full Triforce. 

So without all items from other games, SS Link is already large star level. But we‚Äôre only scratching the surface. Let‚Äôs put Link into a composite form with any item/any feat/ any strength. Hang on, Ladies and Gentlemen it‚Äôs gonna be a fun ride. 

Due to it being composite he has all the experience from every canon game, which is plenty enough to say he‚Äôs not a dumb fighter. Link excels at finding weaknesses with all of his allies (Navi, Fi, Tatl etc) and his sheer experience alone of figuring out riddles dungeons and adventures. 

Let‚Äôs make the body Skyward Sword as he is the strongest of strengths and skill due to defeating the literal Demon God in SS. As composite, he has the memory and strengths of all Links. 

As for stamina, well give him Hero of Twilights stamina, as he is able to swim forever, attack without getting tired.!

Now, let‚Äôs give him some feats of BoTW who has the best athleticism; scaling mountains, taming rivers and being able to literally slow down time by 10x using a flurry rush and by aiming in mid air with a bow. Wild is also able to master all weapons including but not limited to: Spears, Swords, Clubs, Farm tools, bows, axes. 

Items and such: here‚Äôs where it gets fun. Link is known to carry multiple swords, shields, armors and items for his adventuring, so it‚Äôs not uncommon to see this Link packing some serious heat.

Shields: 

The Hylian Shield from SS : 
This shield has been claimed to be indestructible and crafted by The God Dragon Lanayru. This can pretty much just tank any physical attack as it is literally unbreakable. 

The Mirror Shield:
Spanning across 8 games it is the ultimate shield. The most powerful is from the Minish Cap which claims it can deflect any projectile and turn it into a beam. That shoots right back at the opponent casting the projectile. 

Swords:

The Phantom Sword: This blade allows Link to defeat phantoms and creatures on different spectral planes and gives him immunity to life draining curses as shown in The Temple of the Ocean King, thanks to the Phantoms hourglass of course. 

The Four Sword: This lets Link replicate 3 exact clones of himself with equal strength to the original as well w/ every single item. 

The Golden Master Sword (Lvl. 4): First off the Biggorons Sword from OOT has 2x damage as the master sword in its original state. The Master Sword can shoot beams, it can reflect magic the mirror shield cannot, and cancel the immortality of evil beings. The GMS (Lvl. 4) is the base MS leveled up to 4x stronger! And still holds the same feats as the master sword stated earlier in base form, it is the strongest sword in the series. 

Items/Spells: 

Spells: 
Shield Spell/ Daruks protection/ Nayrus Love; creates a barrier allowing Link to not take any damage whatsoever. 
Dins Fire; casts a wide dome of flames that expand around his vicinity. 
Farors Wind; Allows him to transport to a predetermined location at any point. 
Fairy spell; transforms him into a fairy. 
Spell of Healing; it heals his life. 
Reflect Spell: increases durability. 
Quake Medallion: Causes earthquakes. 
Ether Medallion: Summons deadly blizzards.
Miphas Grace: resurrection if he dies (recharges every 8 minutes). 
Revalis Gale: Creates an updraft that shoots him into the sky allowing for arrow barrages. 
Urbosas Fury: Summons lightening but does not damage Link. 
Items/Armor/Magical Clothing

Grandmas Soup: Fills hearts and doubles attack power. 

Ezlo (The Bird hat from Minish Cap): This cap is made of a living bird/hat fusion that allows Link to shrink to the size of a Minish. It also could serve as a warning alarm if he was being attacked from the back, giving him an extra set of eyes. 

Ravios Bracelet: This allows Link to form into walls and remain untouchable for the time he is in the wall unless the wall is destroyed completely or runs out of magic meter. 

Sacred Bow: Does more damage than the master sword (base), shoots arrows in a drill like formation creating more damage. 

Fire/Ice/Shock Arrows: Elemental damage. Enemies frozen with ice or are ice beings in general get one shotted by flame arrows. Vice versa for Flame beings shot by Ice Arrows. 

Light/Silver Arrows: Stunning/Killing evil beings, immortal beings. 

Bomb arrows: Sheer destruction.

Ancient arrows: enemies literally get warped into a black whole type deal immediately on impact and make as an almost guaranteed one shot weapon. 

Bow of Light: cannot use any arrows other than Light Arrows, but creates an infinite amount of Light arrows. The strength/feats is that equal to the Master Sword attack potency and killing of evil beings. 

Hawkeye: basically like a sniper scope with adjustable zoom for the bow. 

Gale Boomerang: Creates a small tornado, is able to be controlled by Link, and causes elemental wind damage. 

Deku Nuts: Stuns enemies in a flash. 

Golden Gauntlets: Increasing Links strength able to toss a large granite pillar piece that weighs about 1000 tons. 

Red Mail: increases overall defense by 75%. 

Magic Armor (Wind Waker): Unlike the Magic Armor that constantly drains 2 rupees/sec in Twilight Princess, this magical upgrade stacks onto Links current armor set and instead of taking damage, loses rupees. In BoTW Link is capable of holding 999,999 rupees. Therefor, this Link may hold 999,999 rupees. 

Fireshield Earrings: allows Link to be in very hot areas without problems (inside volcanos, surrounded by lava etc. 

Water Dragon Scale: Allows Link to breathe under water. 

Rocs Feather/Paraglider: Allows link to jump higher/glide in mid air. 

Magic Cape: Makes Link invisible and untouchable 

The Clock: Zelda I, when used freezes all enemies in time until Link destroys the enemy. 

One Hit Obliterator: A Sheikah weapon that destroys whatever it hits in one single blow, no matter what. But, lowers the users life to where as one hit will kill the user. Can only be used on the great plateau in a controlled Sheikah environment. 

Ocarina of Time: Can manipulate time/weather, teleportation 

Pegasus Boots: Gives Link an extra speed dash and charge attack.

Hover Boots: Let‚Äôs link walk on air for a short period of time. 

Sheikah Slate: Can create unlimited bombs, create/destroy ice with cryonis, any opponent wearing metal can be toyed with using magnesus, summons a master cycle zero, can stop an object/enemy in time and blast them away. 

Bottles of Chateau Romani: Chateau Romani heals all of Links health, and allows him to go 3 days without depleting his magic meter at all. In BoTW you can hold 999 bottles of one certain kind of elixir. 999 x 3 = 2997 days which is roughly 8.3 years. So Link can use any item he has that requires magic for 8 years straight. 

Fierce Deity Mask: A Mask that turns Link into a what the name is called, A Fierce God. This Mask however renders Link without any side weapon items, but armor and rings may stay. 

Triforce: In a few games, Link possesses the full Triforce. The Triforce basically grants any wish and can do anything. Link wants his opponents heart to stop and roll over dead? Triforce would make it happen. It‚Äôs basically the infinity gauntlet of Zelda. One use and you can change reality. 

Rings: Link has 10 fingers, so, 10 rings.

Red Ring: Does x2 sword damage.
Heart Ring Lvl. 2: Heals your hearts after a few steps, considering Link battling, he will be moving around a lot constantly refilling his hearts. 
Power Ring Lvl. 3: Increases ATK Power by 3x. 
Protection Ring: Any and all damage only costs Link 1 heart. 
Charge Ring: Little to no wait time to charge up his spin/hurricane attack. 
Blue Ring: Halves all damage. Now only taking 1/2 heart for any and all attacks. 
Green Ring: Attack is boosted by 50% and damage to link is reduced by 75%. Now Link takes only 0.375 of a heart when attacked. 
Steadfast Ring: Prevents Link from being knocked backwards when defending powerful blows. 
Green Holy Ring: Takes no electrical damage, but will still cause him to stand there for a second. 
Armor Ring Lvl. 3: Sword damage decreases by 1, but damage taken is reduced by 1/4 or a 1/2 a heart. They switch every hit. 

So now Links Sword attack potency is 35x Stronger and is now 31x stronger with other weapons. 

Math: Master Sword Gold Lvl 4= 4x the amount of normal master sword, x 2 from red ring = 8
8 x 3 (Power Ring Lvl 3) = 24
Half of 24 is 12, Green Ring (boosts by 50%) so 24 + 12 = 36.
36 - 1 (from Armor Ring Lvl. 3) = 35.

Sword alone attack potency is 35x stronger than normal. 
Other weapons is 31x due to the -4 from not using the Gold Master Sword. 

Defensive stats are now: 
Start with only one heart per hit (from protection ring)
1 divided by 2 (blue ring 1/2 damage taken) = .5
75% (From Green Ring) of .5 = 0.375
Armor Ring Lvl. 3 will decrease damage taken by either 1/2 or 1/4. 
So every hit Link will take either:

0.375 halved is 0.1875 
0.375 quartered is 0.09375

At this rate it would take around 3 hits to take one heart, or around 11 hits to take one heart. The median is about 6/7 hits on link before he takes one heart of damage, all whilst rehealing every few steps. 

This would make link small solar system level, and once putting on the FD Mask, puts him at large Solar System Level. 


Extra feats for Shits and Gigs; he is able to transform into a wolf allowing him better agility, jump height, sense of smell detecting beings on different planes of existence; and being able to attack and defeat them.",54,public,,0
truezelda,t3_addkb5,"An interesting article I just came across made me long even more for a spin-off game starting one of the other races of Hyrule, and I wanted to share it and ask your thoughts on it","[Here is the article in question.](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/47233/talking-dillon-with-kensuke-tanabe-risa-tabata-and-jun-tsuda)

I don‚Äôt know if anyone has heard of this series. It‚Äôs had, I think, two entries on the 3DS and involves tower defense mechanics while you play as an armadillo whose power is the ability to roll very fast and use that as an attack.

According to the article, the developers originally were going to make a game starring a Goron with those rolling mechanics before deciding to make an entirely new character instead.

Now, talk has gone around for years (probably ever since Majora‚Äôs Mask) about bringing back the concept of playing as another race, possibly for their own game, and people can never quite come to a consensus on it. However, I think the knowledge that a game solely about a Goron almost happened is worth bringing this discussion back.

In case you couldn‚Äôt tell from this post already, I would be all for, and extremely excited for, a game about a Goron or really any Zelda race, it‚Äôs just that the Gorons are my personal favorite.
