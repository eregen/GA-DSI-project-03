zelda,t3_cayoa1,[ALL] Triforce Rules and holders,"I'm thinking of drawing how every piece of the triforce is passed from person to person, what it was used for etc.

For that I need to know all the rules of the Triforce. I know this:

* Only Mortals are able to wish upon the Triforce.

This is why the Golden Goddesses cannot use it to intervene against evil and why Goddess Hylia deems it necessary to be reborn as a mortal (Zelda).

It also means that the Golden Godesses are not omnipotent, since they created the Triforce to give hope to the beings of the surface...unable to forsee its' misuse by Demise and his Forces or its' role in the beginning of different conflicts (The Interlopers, The Twili, The Gerudo)

* Each piece of the Triforce is given to the being that embodies that Triforce piece's virtue the most.

Example: In Twilight Princess....Link just has the Triforce of Courage from the beginning of the game! Just look at the back of his hand! That means that the Hero of Twilight is the most courageous being in Hyrule at that time.

* Only a being who has an equal balance of power, wisdom and courage is able to make a wish upon the triforce

That means that:

\[SS\] &gt;!The Hero of the Sky!&lt;

\[WW\] &gt;!King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule,!&lt;

\[BoTW\] &gt;!Princess Zelda,!&lt;

\[ALBW\] &gt;!The Hero of Worlds and Princess Zelda!&lt;

have an equal amount of Wisdom, Courage and Power at the time of their wishes.

Their wishes were:

\[SS\] &gt;!The Hero of the Sky: Skyloft should return to the surface (thereby sealing away ""The Imprisoned"" forever in theory)....Had this Link just wished ""Kill/Seal away the Imprisoned"" none of the rest of the series would have happened! Think about that!!&lt;

\[WW\] &gt;!King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule: The Flooding of Hyrule.!&lt;

\[BoTW\] &gt;!Princess Zelda: The Sealing of Dark Beast Ganon.!&lt;

\[ALBW\] &gt;!The Hero of Worlds and Princess Zelda: Both wish for Lowrule to gain a new Triforce.!&lt;

* After the Triforce has fulfilled a wish, the pieces are removed from the posession of the person who has made a wish.

In \[WW\], after &gt;!King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule's!&lt; Wish, the Triforce Pieces return to their original owners: Link - Courage, Zelda - Wisdom, Ganondorf - Power

* Shortly before Death, the Triforce Piece held by a Triforceholder, is taken away

As seen in \[TP\], shortly before the Death of &gt;!Ganondorf.!&lt;And in \[WW\], shortly before the Death of &gt;!Ganondorf.!&lt;

* ....That said, I presume it is given to the victor of the battle, as seen in \[LOZ\], where &gt;!Link kills Ganon and retrieves the Triforce of Power from the Ashes.!&lt;
* The sacred Realm is molded to reflect the heart of the person who wishes upon the Triforce

....so does that mean, when for example \[WW\] &gt;!King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule wished upon the Triforce....did he accidentally mold the sacred Realm to match his heart too? He wouldn't have intended it...it would sort of be coincedence.!&lt;

* You are able to split your Triforce Piece into further pieces in order not to have them be found by enemies.

As seen in \[WW\] and \[LOZ\].

* Each Triforce piece gives the holder some level of protection.

\[TP\] &gt;!Ganondorf survives being stabed through the stomach by the ancient sages, breaks through his chains and kills one sage with his bare hand.!&lt;

\[ALL\]....perhaps the Link's survive some encounters due to the Triforce of Courage?

\[ALL\]....Zelda's plans seem to work every time. Is it due to her Wisdom, or because of her Triforce of Wisdom?

What other Rules does the Triforce have?",5,public,Discussion
zelda,t3_cb1g9l,[OoT] Weird ass music glitch in emulated Ocarina,"Hi yall. So this has happened to me a lot of times, and I've figured out the trigger for it, but I still haven't found any mention of this or it being discussed. I don't know if it's against the sub rules to discuss Zelda emulation (it didn't really specify the limits) so if it is, I'm sorry.

So whenever I load OOT on Project64 (I haven't tried it in different emulators) and I get a little hasty with the quick load button, the game's music changes into this.

https://picosong.com/wK446/

(Sorry for the LQ recording)

It stays that way until you move into a different cell (enter/leave an area)

It's been a mystery to me ever since I discovered it. Lowkey creepypasta material. If you wanna try it yourself, just load OOT and then before the Nintento 64 logo appears press quick load (F7). It's not always a guarantee but it works most of the time. Maybe there's a golden area idk.

Is this actually a known glitch that I'm not aware of? I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere. What do yall think?",2,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_caxwj3,[BoTW] How I killed the Lynel on the plateau on a new game in master mode by pretending to be a psychologist.,"I spent over 2 hours after a certain point, with dead angles being my main killer (when he does his charging sweep at a weird ass angle that makes it both undodgable and not able to be parried or block). It got to the point where I started saying funny stuff while fighting to ease my own frustration.

Then I said this, which started a whole freaking conversion until he was dead. I said ""I know, your mother abused you, verbally, physically, even sexually, and you're mad about it and you're taking it out on me!""... I died just as I hit that last part, but continued on that note with my next attempt.

So from there, imagine if you will me yelling stuff like this at the screen as I fought.

""I know why you don't want to talk, this is how Lynels are about problems, they get angry when you talk about them because they consider it a sign of weakness. That's we councilors trained to deal with your species always get combat training, because your client will only open up and talk after you beat the utter shit out of them!

Fight continues more.

""Ready to talk yet, or do you want to keep trying to kill me? It's not that easy to kill me. You'd be better up opening up and talking about your childhood trauma!""

He's now down to 20%

""You still aren't ready to talk? You still want to fight? Jeez, you're a stubborn one, even by with my experience. But then you wouldn't be a Lynel if getting you to open up was that easy.""

5% left

""I know what people have told you, that you're broken, damaged, that you'll never have a normal life. But not me! I will never give up on you, ever! You can trust me, I will help you no matter what it takes! I will work with you until you're better!

He finally goes down.

""Ready to talk now? Good, our session begins for real now.""

What the hell did I roleplay in my head here? And how was THIS the attempt that I beat him on?",5,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_cackgu,[BoTW2] DO THIS BEFORE PLAYING THE SEQUEL,"(Highly over the top title, I know)

Before tackling the BoTW sequel (which I'm hoping will come out late 2020), I thought it would be quite useful to do a few things in BoTW before I start the sequel. This includes:
- Visiting each of the villages within the land and talking to some of the NPCs so that I can remind myself of the current state of Hyrule before entering the sequel.
- Travelling to a few of my favourite places within the game (especially Tarrey Town) as they may change in the sequel.
- Saying goodbye to my horse and leaving him in the stable next to my house as a proper send off.
- Placing all the Champion's Weapons (which I have never actually used as I find them too precious) in the weapon displays in my room (which I already have).
- Finally, heading to Hyrule Castle and defeating the Calamity.

I will probably do this all before starting the sequel (as in, right before playing it) so that I feel accomplished in Hyrule and feel ready to move on to the sequel. It would also be cool to end with the defeat of Ganon as when I move on to the sequel straight after, I will feel as though I am picking up straight where I left off and both of the games will almost feel as one.

Just passing this on in case others want to do the same and really feel invested in the sequel, as I think you'll really be able to grasp the changes that will happen in the sequel. If you have any opinions on this, or any other things you might do before starting the sequel, post your opinions below :)",2352,public,Discussion

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of power does it hold?

Is it a physical thing?

Where's the Triforce located?

I heard that the Triforce had multiple parts; do different people have each part?

What is the basic understanding of the Triforce (things that are always true about the Triforce, no matter the game/installment)?

zelda,t3_cas9a2,[ALL]You most hated and/or feared enemies in the entire series?,"Like-Likes are my most hated. Other enemies can merely kill you. This thing will literally suck you in just by getting too close and eat your shield. If you're not wearing a story significant shield like a mirror shield or something, there goes your shield for good. Better go rebuy it or something. And in OOT, they will EAT YOUR FREAKING TUNIC TOO, if it's a zora or goron one. So yeah, they do more than hurt you, they hurt your equipment and you wallet (since you have to rebuy stuff).

Next is Takkuri from Majoras Mask, a thief bird that can steal everything from basic stuff like money or arrows, or things like your BOTTLES AND YOUR SWORD. Then you got to buy it back from the curiosity shop. So just like Like-Likes, this damn bird also effects in a way far worse than merely taking away health when it hits you, it effects you far more harshly by also stealing your stuff like a Like-Like. It's like a Like-Like with wings... Okay, that's a terrifying image I just imagined.

Finally, the electric weapon guys in Skyward Sword. I was very very good at the motion controls, but even I sometimes swung wrong. Do that on these guys, and you pay for it. If the game throws more than one at you at a time, things are gonna start sucking fast.

zelda,t3_can5m5,[BOTW] What I love,"It seems like this game is a bit controversial in this community granted there is mostly positive feedback while being critical of the game and its shortcomings. 

I am currently on my first playthrough. I have conquered my first two divine beasts and am heading to the Gerudo desert to conquer my third while working on shrines along the way and exploring Hyrule. 

Like others I wish there were more dungeons,  don't love breakable weapons, and hope BOTW 2 brings more challenging bosses. 

That being said, this is an amazing game. I love the non-linear design of the game and the open world concept with Zelda. I miss unique items in each dungeon, but get why that doesn't work with this concept. 

I love how vast Hyrule is. You could put 100 hours into just exploring the terrain. 

I also love the shrines as mini dungeons. I love the focus on puzzles and problem solving as opposed to constant combat.",2,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_cahqvp,[BoTW2] The Mural,"Okay, so I rewatched the trailer today and I'm not sure if anyone's posted about this before, but I noticed a resemblance between this [guy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8zJ2guU0AAfn5P.png) in the [trailer](https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2019/usgamer/rehydrated_ganondorf_featured.jpg) and the [hero in this mural](https://i.imgur.com/BNkKDPS.png). It bothers me that the knight in the mural doesn't look anything like Link, and so I've been wondering since the game's release if the knight was Link or somebody else.

Also, the triforce in the mural is completely on ancestor Zelda's side, which seems to imply that the hero in the mural doesn't have the triforce of courage, and maybe isn't Link (*Although, Link hasn't always had the triforce of courage in every game. Sometimes, Zelda possesses the entire triforce... So maybe this point is moot*). It makes me wonder if the corpse shown in the trailer is actually the knight who fought Calamity Ganon 10 000 years ago. Maybe Ganon was sealed in this knight's body by ancestor Zelda, and the ghostly [hand](https://i.redd.it/skfq4oi71c431.png) sealing Ganon in the corpse belongs to her.

zelda,t3_cair0t,"[ALL] Music appreciation thread, sorry guys I need this","I've always been a huge fan of Zelda music. I highly respect Koji Kondo and I can play a lot of the music on the piano. When I played the Kakariko Village theme from OOT to my dad for the first time, he stopped what he as doing and came to see me play. He told me that he wants me to play this music at his funeral when he will pass. 😖 (Fortunately it should not happen for years or decades!)

Anyway. I've had a long Zelda dry spell recently as I'm away from my Wii U with BOTW. This morning while at work I thought, ""hey why not listen to the 25th anniversary orchestra ost that came with Skyward Sword.""

I put the music as I was working and my productivity dropped to 0%. I could not focus on anything else than my ears. Every hair on my arms and legs was standing right up. When the theme from The Wind Waker came, I unconsciously increased the volume and lost myself to the music.

I was picturing myself, as a child, playing The Wind Waker on my GameCube. I had a small CRT monitor that was on a little blue and pink table. I remember Outset Island, the pigs, the lady with the jar on her head, the pirates, the merchant island (I don't know the English name, sorry!) and the evil fortress. I remember how as a child I was terrified of the God's tower and Gordon. 

Everything, I just saw everything go before my eyes. I would give up everything to be able to experience this for the first time again. I remember the last words of Daphnes Nohanssen Hyrules at the very end of the game. 

When the part with the Red Lion's theme came, I freaking cried. Tears ran down my eyes. I tried my best to refrain myself from sobbing too loud so my coworkers wouldn't know this 22-yo 6'5"" guy is whimpering like a little boy.

Thanks Koji Kondo and everyone who's worked on Zelda music through the ages. This is our generation's Ennio Morricone.

All breath of the wild mechanics still available, gliding, runes, cooking, open-air, etc.
All breath enemies plus darknuts, redeads, poes, iron knuckles, armos, daira, bari, like like, anubis, Skullwalltula, tektite, wallmaster, skulltula, deku baba, arwings(maybe) infinite hand and never before seen enemies.
weapons still break but as we progress in game tools for repairing and scraping and upgrading weapons are found
runes work from near beginning of game plus game has new unique mechanics introduce
120 mini-dungeons but all of them very unique from each other unlike shrines 
8+ epic and huge main dungeons also each very unique from each other
20-40 unique bosses, 16 in the dungeons and the rest in the over-world 
over-world bosses be like the hardest Lyon, hardest Hinox, hardest guardian, hardest darknut, hardest iron knuckle in the world plus many that are completely unique and new. 
under water swimming ******
fishing poles can be used as one of the methods to catch fish
optional motion control sword swinging

zelda,t3_ca4nu5,[BOTW][BOTW2] I would love to see a less post-apocalyptic world in Breath of the Wild 2 and make the towns more alive,"I've been playing a lot of Breath of the Wild lately, and what really sticks out about the game for me right now is how post-apocalyptic and depressing most of the urban areas are. I love the visual direction that Breath of the Wild has taken, and I would love to see some of the major towns and cities being significantly more filled with life. Especially Castle Town. Kakariko Village and Zora's Domain looked wonderful, and I would love to see more areas like those.

Perhaps if Breath of the Wild 2 were set a few hundred years back or forward in time, where Hyrule is restored, it could allow for more beautiful buildings. As I walk across the fields of Hyrule, I constantly find destroyed buildings that all look alike, and just wonder what it would have looked when it was when it was in its best condition. What did Castle Town look like when there were people there? Sure, Twilight Princess and Ocarina of Time both have bustling Castle Towns, and Wind Waker's world is very alive, but imagine the potential using the same assets as Breath of the Wild.

Of course, better dungeons and more things to do in the overworld are both things that I would want more out of the sequel, but some more variety of urban areas rather then several large, destroyed towns, and a few small towns scattered around would really make the world more fun to explore. Especially if the towns were as diverse as what they already are in Breath of the Wild.

zelda,t3_ca5jiy,[BoTW] Can you eventually be strong enough in master mode to eventually pull of what Link does in memory 8?,"https://youtu.be/PMP_M39rpkw?t=692

Posting a link since it makes my question easier to ask. It's a video to the particular memory I am referencing.

So a big thing I like in BotW is the feeling of slowly getting Link back to his full power, going from barely able to handle a black bokoblin to being strong enough to do what he does in that memory, take on a dozen plus enemies including 2 lynels at once (black ones, from the look of it, but the silver of their mane has me unsure). And he did that with basic gear, Master Sword and MAYBE a shield... Granted, that is back when the Master Sword was at full power 24/7, as in how strong it is after trial of the sword in the DLC. On normal, you definitely can get that strong, and I like feeling like I got Link back to that level of strength and skill.

This was all on the Wii U, I am rebuying it for the Switch. I never bought the DLC for that version, but I am for this one. I did my research though, I know Master Mode upgrades all enemies to 1 rank higher than on normal, reds replaced by blacks and silvers replaced by golds and so on, I know enemy camps now have floating platforms enemies snipe from, I know you take double damage, and I know enemies have a rather substantial health regeneration.

But that doesn't TELL me much in regards to how capable Link is by end game. Can Link ever get strong enough with the awakened Master Sword to pull off what happens in that memory with just a sword and shield, in an open fight with no stealth? He can on normal, but what about master?",11,public,Question

However, I've been thinking about it, and it kinda hit me that there's not much evidence to support the last one.

The story goes that Skull Kid, who is from Hyrule, is wandering in the forest (right? The forest?), and then he basically mugs the HMS while he's traveling to sell some of his masks. I've always interpreted that to mean that Skull Kid and the HMS were somewhere in Hyrule during this event, as MM presumably opens in Hyrule (or, at least, in the same world as Hyrule, and not Termina) as well. In addition, the HMS is shown to be pretty savvy about the world around him, implying he's possibly aware of both Hyrule and Termina.

I used Farore's Wind in Jabu Jabu's Belly, and used the grotto next to the shortcut to Goron City in the Lost Woods. I ended up in Jabu, but a heavily bugged-out version of it. Some puzzles were ""solved"", the room before Barinade was inaccessible, Ruto was not present, all the slimy things were red instead of their usual colors, and a door in the bottom part of the dungeon (where you end up after you fall through those weird holes in the 3rd room) was moved a little bit to the left for some reason? It's really confusing. If anyone has any sort of explanation for this, please tell me about it. 

I also put Farore's Wind in Deku Tree and used the same grotto as before. I ended up in Dodongo's Cavern, but got pulled out of the cavern into the loading zone that usually leads back out to Death Mountain (I never pressed anything, it just moved me into the loading zone).

The video is in Dutch so I'll try to translate it here into english in my own words.  
   
&gt;The casting was impossible for this game. There were like 160 different roles so anyone who had a voice had to play a role in that game, just like Reinert [I think that was what Jan said]. So we went to work and Reinert had to play one of these retarded creatures… and I think we never finished recording. We only laughed. But really, we couldn't stop laughing. We laughed so hard that we got cramps and we had to go into the hallway pissing in our pants of laughing. Then I went ""Come on goddammit we have to finnish this recording, Reinert"" and then he would go ""Yeahyeahyeahyeah"". Then we would sit again, look into eachothers eyes and then we would burst out in laughter again. It was so hilarious that this moment has stuck with me ever since.

zelda,t3_c9ns66,[Other] Has Legend of Zelda been an escape for anyone else?,"This post is both like an open love letter to a video game universe that has kept me sane as well as an open invitation to be hear from other people like me.

I feel weird saying this because I know the character of Link was made to be easily identifiable with. But I have recently been going through a few difficult events, and I have fallen back in love with the Legend of Zelda universe and I have been using Link as a way of escaping my problems. I know it isn't the most healthy ways of coping but Legend of Zelda and specifically being able to put myself into Link makes me happy. I have used a lot of things as forms of escapism but I have always returned back to Link.

I find it funny to say that I have always sucked at Legend of Zelda games, I haven't been able to finish a single one, mostly because when I was younger I would just watch my brother play from over his shoulder, but no matter what I always felt like I could put myself in Link's shoes. Be the silent hero that everyone needed that I didn't speak but everyone knew my intentions and that I didn't need to fight for people's attention because I feel like I need their validation.

I always like how in Legend of Zelda there isn't often any hints of Link having any actual romantic attraction to anyone, so you can even further paint yourself into him. But this is something I have noticed as a young gay guy, something I never realized in games how often ""love"" or ""lust"" or ""getting the girl"" can used as a character motivation in games or as a side bonus to winning. But now as a recent adult I have realized how difficult it makes playing games, when I try to escape into a story only to feel like I'm being pushed into a heterosexual relationship. But when I play as Link I never really feel that. Yes, there are ""love"" interests that have feelings for Link but Link never openly returns those feelings unless you believe he does. It's up to your interpretation.

But back to Link. I have always felt an odd personal connection to Link, it might be that I'm blonde, or that if I wear enough green people will make a ""Where's Zelda?"" joke, or that he's brave, quiet, yet loved, all of the things I want to be. But the weird kinship I have towards Link is very odd. It was only further emphasized I recently have come to a cross roads in my life along with starting college. And when I made my decision at said crossroads I felt like that I would be giving up everything that made me feel free and like I had to force all of my imagination and childish curiosity into a box and not talk about it.

But then my brother came home the other day. He bought a Nintendo Switch and we have been playing Super Smash Bros together, and I remembered how much I love Link. So I started saving up to go buy Breath of the Wild. I know I'm late to the party but it feels like I'm catching up with an old friend that I haven't seen in a long time. It feels safe and non-judgmental, like all my fears don't matter, that I can forget about my troubles and just go run in a field and be a kid again. It feels weird to say that I can be a kid again, when I'm only 18, but right now Legend of Zelda is really what is keeping me together.

But that's all I really want to say, while this post might be weird or unwanted by some, because it's more emotional based and not 100% about Legend of Zelda and is partially about myself. But I just wanted to share how much Legend of Zelda and Link mean to me. So overall what do you guys think? Does anyone else have a similar experience?",32,public,Discussion

(Spoilers for a 20 year old game ahead)
For anybody who doesn't know, in Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker hyrule and all of the land surrounding hyrule is submerged in hundreds of feet in water. Near the end of the game you learn that Hyrule castle and Ganon's castle are perserved in an underwater bubble until you defeat gannon and the water surrounding both falls in and submerges the castles meaning all of the surrounding land you explore in Breath of the Wild was at some point submerged in all the water.

zelda,t3_c9mnmj,[TP] Am I the only one who was disappointed in the Arbiter's Grounds?,"I'd heard a lot of praise for the Arbiter's Grounds, primarily due to its item and boss...but when I played it, I thought these, ironically, took it completely off the rails.

Starting out, it's really strong. A cursed/haunted desert compound where scarabs swarm after you open a chest, mummified warriors stalk the halls, and sand threatens to swallow you up while phantom vermin crawl around your body. It's the mummy's-curse setting with the Egypt filed off and it's great. Your pre-dungeon item is Wolf Link now that you can change at will, and that's integrated well. It's fantastically creepy, even if it does suffer from a blatant Forest Temple (OoT) rehash and underuse of the lantern (they give us free oil and only one room is built around it?). Even the mini-boss is really fascinating.

So that was a very promising first half. And then the second half of the dungeon gives us the Spinner, and we've gone from an atmospheric spooky place with history to a silly skate park. 

What?

I didn't even find the Spinner all that fun, for one, but conceptually, it just ruins the dungeon's trajectory and feels like a cool idea that got shoehorned in without consideration for context; the worst kind of ""gameplay first"". The only thing that worked for me was using it as a gear in mechanisms, but why would an ancient punishment ground have a wall-riding vehicle like that? I'd expect it in some kind of industrial facility where Spinners were the typical means of conveyance, but here? The use in the boss was creative and well-done, yes, but it still feels wrong, especially since the Spinner only has use in the half it's introduced and has minimal application outside of the dungeon. A good item should change the way you look at the whole dungeon and be useful outside as well. If it was a fast way to get around the overworld, that'd be great, but it's only fast in the dungeon...which makes it feel like it doesn't even get enough time because you're blazing through the rooms.

I don't know. TP had some fantastic dungeons, and while I hated the City in the Sky aesthetically and puzzle-wise, at least it wasn't so *messy*. This one just didn't work for me as a whole.

tl;dr: The Spinner item kills the mood of the Arbiter's Grounds and feels out-of-place in every way, and let down my experience in the dungeon.",6,public,Question

zelda,t3_c94mz7,[BotW2] An exceptionally unpopular opinion on how I think the Hookshot could be implemented in the sequel (if that game will be more or less like Breath of the Wild).,"I think the Hookshot should be implemented...as a durability item. *CUE THE PITCHFORKS*

Look, i understand why the breaking weapons is such a controversial mechanic. Nobody likes they favorite weapons going away, and nobody likes the feeling of getting 'weak'. 
Hell, in the beginning, it was something that was really frustrating for me to accept.

However, that doesn't stop the durability system from making complete sense for a wide open world game like BotW, where you have so much goddamn freedom that you can also fight the final boss one to two hours after starting the game. 

It isn't just implemented to encourage you to experiment with different weapons without sticking to mostly the same setup throughout the entire mid-late game, it's also to balance out the overworld. To not make the player too over powered too quickly, while avoiding putting the games progression behind a generic leveling up system. 

Could they make the weapons break less frequently in the sequel? I mean, maybe. It depends on how the developers balance out the game. But I don't really think it matters much. Fucking thing is gonna break anyway. 

Could they make the weapons fixable? ..No, not really. That would practically be the same as having unbreakable weapons, if not worse, because now you have the joy of a constantly cluttering inventory with weapons that need fixing. And then of course, they also need to get repaired. Personally, I kinda just think its best that the weapon break and that's it. 

I remember on my original playthrough, I got the Edge of Duality early on at a (more lengthy but not difficult) shine in Hyrule Field. A heavy weapon with 50 attack power. 
Despite the fact that it was disheartening that the weapon would break, I also knew that, if I could keep the weapon indefinitely (even if it could be repaired) the games difficulty would probably have snapped in half. Having it break, means Im gonna be more careful to not just overuse it. 
Getting more powerful then usual weapons might create a dilemma, but it also creates a decision.
Besides, there are weapons EVERYWHERE in Breath of the Wild. In some places, I would actually say that it's too forgiving. To the point where that and the cooking can make you pretty damn overpowered. 
And of course, the level tuning for progression also helps. 


.. Oh and as for the Hookshot? 
Well.. Just as i think it is important that the player don't get too powerful with the combat, the same is true with traversal. 

As much as I love the Paraglider in BotW, I do think that and climbing kinda trivialises getting to places. The Great Plateau showed some really cool potential on how you could traverse the overworld, like cutting down a tree to make a bridge. However stuff like that is generally underutilised throughout the rest of the game. Its something I would like to see more of in a later game. Just as there's creative ways to defeat enemies, the same could be true with going from point A to B in the world (that's not just gliding and climbing) 

However an unlimited useble Hookshot, even if it needs to be upgraded, could probably still trivialise getting to hard to reach places, and even just in general. 
And that's where my idea of a breakable Hookshot comes in. That way the item can be fully functional, where you can hook on to almost everything, including rock walls. But the durability means that you probably won't overuse it. That you'll make a decision if its worth it. 

The Hookshots should, of course also be multi-purposed. This could also help with decision making. 
Let's say that you want to cross a cliff, and you see a rock that's close enough to be hooked on to. However, because hooking on to rocks consumes more durability then something like wood, and you generally also prefer to use the item in combat, it might motivate you to find another creative way to get across instead. 

Just like the weapons, there should be different levels of the Hookshot, which determines how far they can reach.",16,public,Discussion

As I'll do every so often, I looked up the page for OoT on Tvtropes after beating it, and it's struck me that *nothing* really good happens after OoT.

In the Adult Timeline, Link is sent back into the past after sealing Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, so that he can actually have his childhood, so to speak. However, without a hero, when Ganondorf soon breaks out of the Sacred Realm, there is no one to defend Hyrule. Zelda, just as she once did as a child, ends up screwing Hyrule over. Then the gods end up having to ""seal"" Ganondorf by drowning all of Hyrule.

In the Child Timeline, Link returns to his ""normal"" life, and he and Zelda foil Ganondorf by essentially calling 911. While Ganondorf is rather easily thwarted, Link ends up losing so many of his friends, including, of course, Navi. Not only that, Link has his reputation destroyed because everyone thinks he killed the Great Deku Tree, and all his ""previous"" heroic efforts essentially never happened, making him a forgotten hero.

Link then goes on an adventure to find Navi, but, not only ends up leaving empty-handed, but also perishes afterwards (while still being a kid!), and his anguished spirit lives on for who knows how long.

In addition to Link getting screwed over big-time, Ganondorf's execution is botched, and he ends up having another go at oppressing Hyrule.

As for the Fallen Timeline, well, that's the Fallen Timeline; everyone is screwed.

Now, if we add up all the three timelines, this is what we get: for Hyrule, it either a) gets flooded, b) is conquered by Ganondorf, or c) actually has at least some temporary peace.

For the Hero of Time, he either a) dies at Ganondorf's hands; b) is a successful hero, but goes MIA; or c) has his reputation and life destroyed, gets forgotten as the hero, fails to find his friend, ends up dying shortly thereafter, and lives on as a regretful spirit for however long.

Man, I'm really starting to think that Ocarina of Time is way darker than people give it credit for...

What do you guys think?

**Tl;dr: After OoT, Hyrule is destroyed in two timelines, and Link is SOL in all three of them.**

Edit: as I said in one of my comments, I think what really separates OoT from the other Zelda games is the [fridge logic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fridge/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime) it has in abundance. I now really believe that Ocarina of Time's story blows every other Zelda story out of the water.

zelda,t3_c8tvq3,[BoTW] X-Post: Sheikah Technology as an allusion to Fukashima?,"Sheikah technology is a central focus of BOTW but I haven't seen a dedicated analysis of the developers' presentation of it anywhere. I'm going to start by pointing out some visual cues.

Color reference:
https://i.imgur.com/Uo7Ka5s.jpg

Consider that all activated Sheikah technologies have a distinctive blue glow. This blue glow should be compared to the characteristic blue glow, so-called ""[Cherenkov Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation)"", given off by nuclear fission reactors when their charged particle radiation travels through a polarizable non-conducting medium, such as water. 

Dormant Sheikah technologies have an orange glow. This glow should be compared to the glow of, e.g. [Plutonium-238 exposed to oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium-238). Plutonium-238, a radioactive material which emits a barrage of alpha particles (essentially helium nuclei which are relatively safe to humans), is often utilized as a portable source of energy for space missions and even pacemakers, similar to a battery. 

Corrupted Sheikah technology glows a purple-ish red, a color similar to [ionized air with a high nitrogen content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized-air_glow). 

Considering Japan's recent nuclear catastrophe, it seems possible that Nintendo set out to explore the good and evil of related technologies, even if in a cryptic way. I haven't totally unraveled this, but I think there are some mechanics in this game that become clearer with the concept that nuclear energy powers the tech.

First, note that shrine placement is usually near points of interest, such as stables, towns,  dungeons. This makes sense for the game, but also fits well with the possibility that shrines were once power plants, safely tucked underground. 

After activating the towers, we are tasked with travelling to each shrine. Each shrine initially has an orange glow, as if it's running on aforementioned back-up Plutonium-fed thermal generators. After activating the shrine, it glows blue as if it has been switched to fusion power and is connected to the continent's power grid. It seems the function of the Sheikah slate is to reverse locks on fusion power production, not dissimilar to the locks used irl for plants which need to switch to back-up gasoline power during a crisis which threatens the reactors.

Next, corrupted guardians and divine beasts have a red-purple glow, which as mentioned, is similar to ionized air. Ionization could (fictionally) occur if the internal circuitry was disconnected, and caused electrical arcs, as if someone had gone in and rewired the them on the fly. 

In this light, it seems like Link's quest is to essentially restore the technological components of Hyrule's power and technology grid after some catastrophe causes its complete shutdown. This also makes me question if malice somehow represents nuclear waste or byproducts that were unleashed after a catastrophe, in parallel with the fallout following Fukashima which caused vast swaths of land to become inhabitable. 

I also wonder if Zelda's perceived negligence to her duties to the impending threat of Ganon is somehow meant to parallel and allude to the negligence of [TEPCO to meet the safety requirements to prevent the Fukashima accident] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster) from an inevitable natural disaster. 

 I hope this is thought provoking/interesting. I never considered that BOTW could be an artistic response to a real disaster, but it seems like this could be the case.

I don't think it's from the original soundtrack, any of the reorchestrated albums, or the 25th or 30th anniversary albums either. I also thought that it might be from Batphone too, but it's not chiptune.

Also I started journaling my quest in a blog, focusing on a retrospective look at the tenants of game design!

# PlayLog - LoZ: Twighlight Princess (2006) #5

So yeah, it’s taking a while to finish this thing.  Last night found  me lost in the yard of Hyrule castle, staring down a truly confusing  triforce-themed puzzle. But the end is in sight, and I, for one, am  ready to put this thing to bed. 

**An eco-pology** \- In an  earlier post I complained about the game economy, which commits the  crime of maxing out your wallet long before it gives you anything to  buy. Since then the game economy has leveled out some. There quickly  becomes a good number of ammo-based weapons that need re-filling, and a  few donation boxes that let you dump your surplus loot towards various  side-quests. The end result of one of these quests is Link’s magic  armor, which makes you invulnerable at the price of slowly melting away  your rupee count. I’m into this, it’s a clever way to keep the currency  collecting meaningful in the end game once you’ve bought everything  there is to buy. There are also late-game sections that require large  sums of money to complete, which I think are intended to drive you  towards the mini-dungeons hidden around the world, many of which reward  you with big ol’ gemmies.  

**Agitha** \- There’s also a girl who is *loaded*  and will pay you disgustingly well to supplement her bug collection,  which makes for a fun ignorable fetch-quest scenario. Seriously though,  the way Agatha is written makes me queasy. It’s the kind of revulsion I  imagine a girl having for her boyfriend’s body-pillow collection.  I’ll admit, I first came across this character in Tecmo’s “Hyrule Warriors”  musou game, and based on that I had assumed she would play a larger role  in TP.  I guess I was thinking she’d be a dungeon NPC, along the lines  of the strange Yetis that inhabit the accursed Ice Temple. But no. It’s  clear to me now that she made it in there on fetish value alone.  Whatever she’s doing with those bugs, it’s probably immoral. 

**Temple of Time**  \- has been my favorite dungeon so far. It could be that the Dominion  Rod is just the best - such a cool item that sadly only gets real good  use in this area of the game. I could be wrong, not having the context  of playing the early games, but it feels like the enemies in this  section are supposed to evoke monsters from earlier Zelda games, in both  their function and their visual design. The puzzles were cool and  interesting. But it’s probably my favorite because I breezed through,  start to finish. Ahhh. 

**City in the Sky** \- It’s not that  I dislike mechanical design of this temple, but damn. Why’d it have to  be Ooccoos. This is the first time I’ve been 100% turned off to a  temple’s aesthetics. I guess I was prepping for some kind of ancient,  clockwork, bird-peopled contraption. Instead it was more of the freaking  nightmare harpies and some kind of UFO/stonework interior design.  Points for using the cucco-drifting as a puzzle mechanic, points for  double-clawshot, which is a fun evolution of the item. Maybe it  should’ve just been a cucco temple, how funny would that have been? In a  game where you can talk to animals, I’d love it if the cuccos were  actually descended from a race of sky-faring smart-chickens. Maybe they  are? Ugh, the Ooccoos’ language sounds like the screams of burning  children. Whatever, it’s done.",2,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_c8g1wp,[TP] TP really got shafted for its “HD” version,"Just a thought I’ve been having lately, but man TP really deserved much better when it was getting the HD treatment.

For starters, it released at the end of the Wii U’s lifespan when it was already an arguable failure of a console. 

While the updated textures look great, the crisper image of the game gives light to the poorly aged character models and environments, as well as rather stiff animations (Link fishing for example)

When compared to WWHD, they’re both simple remasters with QoL improvements, but WWHD benefits from that more than TPHD did. WW’s artstyle is much less realistic and detailed so it has aged much better and benefited from a “coat of paint”

Twilight Princess deserved a bigger scale actual remake with redone character models, new engine, etc. simply because its artstyle would’ve benefited from it. Not to mention it had hardly the amount of QoL updates WWHD had.",11,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_c8hkyh,[BOTW2] My thoughts on how to improve the weapon system and durability (long read),"With BOTW2 coming up and this still being a hot topic I thought I'd share my thoughts on this matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like player choice and customization are important aspects of any game and this goes double for RPGs and adventure games. Everyone likes to play differently so it's important to accommodate this option through player choice. I suggest two major changes to how weapons work:

&amp;#x200B;

The first change is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

When weapons break, instead of exploding into thin air, they should simply become a ""broken"" version of themselves. For those of you who have played OoT, it's similar to what happens to the giant's knife.

When broken, weapons would have severely hampered stats. For example, a broken sword would simply become a hilt with a small blade with something like 20% of the original attack power and a reduced reach. These versions of the weapons will not break any further but they still take up a weapon slot.

Players should also be able to repair their weapons at the cost of minerals, monster parts, and rupees at towns. It goes without saying that the more advanced weapons would have a greater cost of repair than the more basic ones.

What this does is introduce a choice every player has to make whenever their favorite weapon breaks: Either keep carrying their now very useless weapon and give up a weapon spot so you can repair it later OR toss it and grab a new one.

This change WOULD require to some tweaking though, I would suggest a much smaller carry limit for weapons of all types but with increased durability overall.

This change would also let players become more attached to their favorite weapons which, in my opinion, is a good thing because it would feel that much better to find a good one. 

&amp;#x200B;

This next part comes from the RPG player in me so some of you might disagree, but bear with me:

&amp;#x200B;

To further the concept, I think weapons should consist of more that simply 1 single attack stat and their appearance, because that's a very boring way to differentiate them. Weapons should have varying reach, attacks speed, crit chance, attack power, elemental power, status effects (poison, for example), slots (more on this later), etc.

BOTW had some cool elemental weapons but they were one of a kind and honestly very broken in terms of power. Shock weapons should not instantly shock your enemies, they should slowly build up ""shock damage"" and then shock them when you hit a certain threshold. Let's say the threshold is 100 and you weapon has 10 electric damage, then you should hit them 10 times before the enemy is ""shocked"". The same goes for other elements.

Slots would be an extra layer of customization, where player could enhance certain aspects of their favorite weapons. They could be crafted from gems and applied to weapons, enhancing whatever stats the player prefers. A weapon of the same ""level"" with two slots would have lower stats than one with none, but would also allow the player to specifically upgrade the stats they want.

With weapons varying this much, it would be very hard to define what the ""best sword in the game"" is, because it would all come down to preference. Maybe some people prefer brute attack power, whereas others would prefer some attack speed and elemental/status to apply the effect quickly. Finding weapons would become that much more exciting when instead of finding a ""soldier's sword"" identical to the other 20 you've run through over the course of your playthrough, it could be that one ""soldier sword"" with a fast attack speed, frost damage and 1 slot you can use to upgrade elemental damage. Now, instead of just running through it and tossing it when broken, which would still happen frequently with weapons you didn't particularly like, you could upgrade it and just repair it when it breaks.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapons should also be repaired/upgraded exclusively at town smiths to avoid breaking the combat system completely. Let's say all weapons could be upgraded 3 times, similar to how you can upgrade your armor, with slightly increased stats and durability for each upgrade. Since players would now have favorites, it makes sense to have a proper way to store weapons you don't want to currently carry.

&amp;#x200B;

The fast travel system would also need some tweaking to avoid excessive and monotonous warping back and forth to repair or switch weapons, but that's a discussion for another time haha

&amp;#x200B;

If you got this far, thanks a lot for reading! What are your guys' thoughts on this? I'd love to hear your feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Broken weapons should still take up a slot but be repairable at towns. More stats and customization options to differentiate weapons would be cool.",5,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_c8aron,"[OTHER] It's interesting just HOW DIFFERENT two back to back titles in the series are, between Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild.","I mean, one is LITERALLY the most linear Zelda in the series, and the next is the least linear. One treats the overworld like a dungeon with specific routes and puzzles just to get through the area, the other treats it like a living natural world that lets you pretty much wherever you want without much is any impediment. One's combat is all about precise strikes to get through the enemy's guard, the other is about free form combat that is far more than just sword swinging (bomb your enemy, freeze them and hit them, whack them with a metal object with magnet, throw a club at them, do a slow mo arrow shot to their head from above, and much much more... SS was mostly just swinging your sword in the right direction until the enemy died). Ties into the linearity, but it's also worth noting how segmented SS was, with how each area is completely separate from each other, and how different sections of the story will basically lock you into a specific area that you can't leave until you're done, while BotW doesn't do any segmenting at all aside from making the plateau cut off from the rest of the map until you get the glider. Finally, SS has a large amount of dungeons, that are all quite complex and lengthy, whereas BotW's dungeons are short and quick affairs that you will be done with in 5 minutes if you know the solutions already.

My point is, it's the biggest 180 degree turn I have ever seen in any franchise. It's like they took everything SS did and decide to make it backwards, and that's how they got BotW. Hell, maybe that IS what they did, just reversed everything from SS as an experiment and see how it worked out. Since the reaction is almost universally praised and SS is almost universally korok-seeded on, the experiment paid off. But yeah, they're so different they may as well be opposites on the elemental chart, like ground versus wind. They're both Zelda, and yet I don't think they could be more different if tried... And I think they in fact DID try. Seems that even Nintendo didn't like SS much in the end, since they went so far out of their way to make the next Zelda mainline game as different as physically possible.",12,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_c83ung,[BoTW] Breath of the Wild reignited my love for the Zelda series,"Backstory: I'm a dude that has been playing Zelda for 19 years and, for quite some time I've grown tired of the basic formula of the games that are famous for, resorting to other options such as Fire Emblem to name an example. But everything changed when Calamity Ganon attacked.

The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is my absolute favorite game, period, not only making me develope a slight adiction when I first played it, but also reminding me why I love the Zelda series so much and why they're important in my life: The Sense of Discovery and Spirit of Adventure. What are these two aspects?

Let's start with The Sense of Discovery. To me, life is all about discovery; learning about yourself, the world, people around you, experiences.. you know the drill. Discovery means to have an open mind to get out, observe and analyze about everything, to be a philosopher to say the least, and understand the joy of learing (one basic need for us humans to progress and evolve everyday IMO). In the Zelda games this translates to the sense of inspecting every corner looking for treasure, dungeons, thrills, learing new techniques, power-ups, finding new characters, progressing in the story.

The Spirit of Adventure is more like a mantra of sorts, consisting of the mindset of basically being a foreing crusader in a strange, twisted world that changes constantly, and you, the player, is forced to fight through thousands ordeals or face inminent stagnation (which in my case means death). An Adventurer is a person that, despide having the odds against him fights on, breaking through different obstacles and thus gaining experiences to be a more competent Hero, a better person. In Zelda games this means exploring dungeons despite being in the constant danger of being overwelmed by powerful foes at every turn. Victory or Death, nothing else exists.

Breath of the Wild encapsulated these two views perfectly (akin to the very first Zelda game) and made me realize that, if I want to grow stronger, a better version of myself then I must be brave enough to make difficult decisions from time to time (such as moving away from my hometown) because self-improvement is the best way to yell at the world ""I'm alive and kickin'!"".

So, just to finish my wall of text, I'll say that I adore what Nintendo did with the franchise this time and I can't wait to see a ""darker"" version of Breath of the Wild coming in the next 4 years from now on. Will the game be worth the wait? Absolutely, as long as there are discoveries to be made and adventures to take there's nothing that will ruin this new experience.

zelda,t3_c85803,[BoTW] A disturbing realization/theory I made about the Gerudo.,"
In Breath of the Wild, the Gerudo are unique in the fact that they are an almost entirely female species. Note the almost. 

Anyone familiar with Zelda lore knows that the Gerudo only have one male born to them every hundred years. Genetic impossibilities aside, one would expect a male Gerudo to be seen at one point throughout the series. However, the only one who has even been seen on a game is Ganondorf, King of Evil.  This is odd, especially since a time jump of 100 years is made in Breath of the Wild, meaning that one male Gerudo had to have been born during that time period.

So where are all the other male Gerudo?

*They were murdered*.

Our first clue is that the Gerudo are clearly ashamed that they were indirectly responsible for the creation of Ganondorf, as Urbosa mentions both in her diary and the cutscene in which Vah Naboris is activated.  

Furthermore, the Gerudo in general hold a a strong distaste for men in general, hence why any are attacked upon entering the city. The one time they allowed a man into their tribe, he brought Hyrule to ruin, so it makes since that the wouldn’t want a repeat of that situation.

Thirdly, in the Breath of the Wild book Creating a Champion, it is stated that the practice of male Gerudo becoming king ended with Ganondorf. However, this doesn’t seem to mean male Gerudo have stopped being *born*, since it’s treated as more of an uncontrollable supernatural occurrence than anything else.

Imagine it from the Gerudo’s perspective. Every hundred years, a child is born. The last child that you let live not only shamed your race, but nearly destroyed the entire world and everyone in it. You can’t risk anything like that happening again. So every one hundred years, when the inevitable happens, you do what needs to be done to ensure past mistakes are not repeated.

TL;DR: The Gerudo are killing any male Gerudo that are born so that the mistake of Ganondorf is never repeated.",9,public,Discussion

Recently I played a new save just to relive my favorite boss in the game which happens after this temple is over. So this was terrifying and gave me horrible stress.

Other note: The Hallway between rooms in the Lakebed Temple has vines on the left (or right depends) where you can claw shot and drop down into a stream with active enemies.

When I listen to the Spirit Tracks soundtrack, I can actively imagine Link adventuring, a good thing for any soundtrack to achieve. Soundtracks should always paint a detailed picture in your mind, and that's a strong theme in this soundtrack. I would list my favorite tracks, however there are just too many good ones. I think my picks for favorite are ""Aboda Village"", ""Full Steam Ahead!"" and ""In the Fields"".

BotW already broke new ground with it's open world and disposable weapons, allowing you to control two characters at once would be a good way to double down(no pun intended) on that and blow people's mind two games in a row.

zelda,t3_c7jp6x,[SS] Skyward Sword - A great Zelda game burdened by unreliable controls,"One more amateur review and I'm back to lurker status. Finally finished SS this year and I'd like to talk about it.
___
___
___
So...I can firmly say that I both love and hate Skyward Sword. As a big chapter in Zelda history? I love it, I really do. Because of the circumstances of my life, I've become very comfortable with watching speed runs and walkthroughs on YouTube, and if I had done that with SS, I would probably have a glowing review of it. As the (retroactive) first chapter of the entire Zelda story, it is great. But, as an enjoyable video game that's meant to offer you consistent entertainment? It made me miserable on far too many occasions. I honestly can't remember the last time a game left me so frustrated.
___
Let me be clear about this because I'm not just out to anger fans of SS. I've seen all of the criticisms made about the game over the years and refused to believe the game was as bad as so many said it was. I honestly hate to say it, but I wound up agreeing with most of the people who were critical of the game, and it's mostly because of the motion controls. SS was a game that was hampered by the gameplay. I hate to even make these complaints because I really like the idea behind motion controls, and I thought that traversing through a Zelda game with motion controls would have been a satisfying experience. The only real experience I've had with motion controls came from Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2, and I can't say enough about how amazing they both were. 

I thought people criticized Skyward Sword solely due to a general disdain of motion controls, but I see now that it wasn't that - it was that the motion controls made things difficult. And believe me - it wasn't like I randomly flung the Wiimote around to make progress. I can't count the number of times I gave a specific input and the console seemed to detect whatever it wanted to. A great example - the shield parry. I clearly remember a point during the final Ghirahim fight where I firmly pressed the Wiimote against my thigh to leave no room for error in my attempt to shake the nunchuk to get a parry, and I *still* wound up with a vertical spin slash attack. There were thousands of similar mistakes and they all greatly hindered the combat...*and* made it very easy for enemies to chip away at my health. Just standing around and swinging the sword in specific directions works great. Going through a battle and giving specific directions only to wind up with a random slash that allows the enemy to block and hit within seconds? Not so great.
___
Past that, the game felt very tedious. I get into this nice little world that the developers have carved up, I want to see what it has to offer. You can do that, but first you need to do this thing which will lead to this thing, and then that will give you time to prepare for *the next thing*, which will give you a cutscene that directly transitions into the next thing. That complaint might sound ridiculous because this is *kind of* how most games are designed - what I'm saying is it felt as if there was no breathing room whatsoever. The lingering feeling of being obligated to fulfill the next objective felt seriously egregious, and any enjoyment I hoped to find from ""exploring"" had to come from working towards the next obligation...and THIS felt ridiculous because the game feels like one long puzzle. That's another complaint that's difficult to make because there's no denying the fact that the world is well designed. It has the exact kind of solid and meticulous work that I've come to expect from a Zelda game. Sometimes, I was intrigued and liked figuring out how things functioned. Other times, it felt like the puzzles were just slowing me down and preventing me from enjoying the game.

(the biggest mistake I made was going from BOTW to this game. what can I say? I was holding out hope for a remaster of SS.)
___
___
I didn't *want* to dislike Skyward Sword, it simply sapped away any enthusiasm I had, chewed it up, spit it out, and made me clean up the mess. It's even frustrating to look back on my playthrough. See, I'm not the type of person who is easily frustrated by a game, and I've never been someone who would turn a game off if it did frustrate me. I always think *""nah, I can push through this and get to the next save point"".* Skyward Sword wore me out multiple times. SO, why post this? I just wanted to talk about the experience, I guess. As I said earlier, Skyward Sword has many, MANY good elements. I would still say it's worth playing for the lore additions alone. But ultimately, I'm just not looking forward to playing SS again.
___
one more random thought...

I both love and hate the fact that Ghirahim was the hardest boss of the game. Love it because it was a worthwhile boss battle and an interesting swan song for the character. Hate it because it seems like it cheapened the Demise boss battle. I seriously took a break after beating Ghirahim because I thought the Demise boss battle would be the moment that made me hate motion controls forever, and then it wasn't really anything. Just some crafty maneuvering and bam, the ancient threat is out of the picture. Buzzkill. I *guess* you could say that the fight was so easy because the entire game was meant to portray Link's journey towards becoming the destined hero and that by the time he reached Demise, he was more than capable of dealing with him easily, but I didn't really feel that way. Again, just seemed like the Ghirahim fight had more meaning.

zelda,t3_c81cdo,[All]Been Thinking About the Timeline: Is the OoT Battle Pointless,"So after watching the new e3 trailer for BoTW2 I've been thinking about the Zelda Timeline again. I've never been a fan, it always reeked of retcon and hindsight; I would honestly rather just see each game as a retelling of the same story rather than trying to push everything into a ""universe"" (as I honestly doubt was ever intentioned prior to maybe WW). Anyway, I always hear people talking about how cool it is that there is a timeline where we see the aftermath of the hero losing the battle in OoT. After looking at what happens in the preceding games I started to realize something that made me a little upset: there really isn't a lot of difference between what happens if the hero wins or loses. Let me put it this way:

Adult Timeline - Link defeats Ganon and Ganon is sealed away by the sages with the Triforce of Power. Over time the seal breaks down and Ganon escapes to take over Hyrule because the Hero is absent.

Defeated Timeline - Link is defeated by Ganon, but the sages just seal him away anyway this time with the whole Triforce. Over time the seal breaks down and Ganon escapes to take over Hyrule because the Hero is absent. 

So, is there really anything that the Hero accomplishes by defeating Ganon in OoT besides I guess the creation of the Child Timeline? Honestly, I think you could make a serious argument that things end up a lot *better* for Hyrule if Link *loses.* In the defeated timeline Hyrule is taken over by Ganon briefly through a coup and then is defeated in the events of LttP. But in the adult timeline where he wins Ganon is able to seize complete control of Hyrule and this results in the complete destruction of Hyrule by flood. So what the heck am I even fighting for in OoT? Am I missing something, or is this just a case of another piece of ""lore"" that the timeline screws up?",1,public,Discussion

I have several theories about BotW since it launched but now with the sequel trailer, I just HAD to come up with another one lol (said no Zelda fan ever).  
Contrary to what most people say that BotW takes place at the end of all timelines, **I think they made a 4th timeline** (alternate world) that is separte and parallel to the 3 previously known ones. 

***The timeline of Captivity/Calamity.***  
As an alternative to killing Demise's reincarnations, they (a civilization or group that *KNOWS*... ^(could be the Sheika or Zonai)) grabbed Ganondorf and kept it 'alive' for ages, breaking the cycle of Demise's curse. That way he won´t reincarnate. But the hatred and malice of Ganondorf accumulates every ten thousand years (Calamity Ganon).

The thing is, a lot of stuff lead to Ganondorf being under the Hyrule Castle... So that's how *""the history of the royal family of Hyrule is also the history of the calamity Ganon""*? That's the concept I have in mind to the placement of this timeline and the introduction of Calamity Ganon.",1,public,Discussion

I remember beating it and it being my favorite game for a while. Then time comes by and I finish Majora's mask wind waker tp and half way bet skyward. When botw came out and when I played it I realized beating all the other Zelda's where worth it and bet botw. Few years later not playing a Zelda game since the botw 2nd dlc I booted up ocarina of Time on the 3ds played it for a while and got bored. I was thinking why am I not enjoying it as much as when I first got it. This is actually the same for any Zelda for me now  especially botw. Anyway after seeing the botw 2 trailer a bit of Zelda Spirit has woken in me again. So leave comments if you have any experience of not enjoying a Zelda game after you have beaten one and why I'm probably experiencing this because Zelda is my favorite gaming series right under Mario.

zelda,t3_c7nsr5,"[MM] Majora's Mask's best ending causes a time convergence of the entire playthrough, but think about the implications.","In the best ending, somehow, it shows ALLLLL the people you've helped all getting their best ending, even people you only helped on a single 'timeline' before playing the song of time and starting over. Obviously, the goddess of time decided to help Link one last time by combining all his good deeds over the course of dozens or hundreds of 3-day sequences into one single sequence.

But imagine how that must LOOK. You go out to Termina Field, only to see dozens or even hundreds of lookalikes running all over the place. Over here there's 20 of the exact same goron rolling somewhere, 30 boys in a green tunic riding 30 of the exact same horse all going different directions. At the sea, there's at least a dozen of the exact same zora all swimming all over the place. Multiple versions of Link are in all 4 main dungeons simultaneously. While he's helping Kefei get back together with Anju, he's solving a dungeon, helping Romani fight ghosts, swimming in a race against humanoid beavers, shooting Tingle down over and over and over for an hour because WHY THE HELL NOT, while going through a freaky well filled with mummies. Plus literally a hundred other things at once on top of all that.

So yeah, imagine that every 3 day cycle you did now has its own Link running around separate from the others. THAT is how a perfect file of Majora's Mask looks from an outside observer. It's a little, uh, insane.",8,public,

Looking to get into the legend of Zelda series. Got a 3ds a month or two ago, been playing some pokemon and new super ~~smash~~ mario bros 2 on it. I want to play the legend of Zelda games since people are recommending it. Reading around, I've seen most people say to play the game in release date order instead of timeline. I'm not really looking to play all the games, just like 4-5 of the most important ones and get to the most recent one (I think Link's Awakening?). But I don't really know which ones are the most important so I'm looking for a bit of help. I'm also not really looking to play spinoffs because I just want to play the main games, I might decide to play those later.

zelda,t3_c7ktbk,[BotW2] So.. About the new game.,"I know that this has been talked about to death, but do you guys seriously think that they are just gonna use the exact same map as BotW, with some changes and enhancements?  I know Breath of the Wild's overworld had some flaws and missed potentially, but I can't see Nintendo just making a 'better' version of a game they released a few years prior. Even though they using the same engine and everything. 
It would kinda be like Bethesda releasing a new Elder Scrolls that still takes place in Skyrim, but now there's even BETTER stuff in that same map, aaaaaaand less of the stuff that people didn't like. I do actually think something like that could be cool, but no matter how much there change, wouldn't it kinda just seem like an expansion?

And yes, I know what Aonuma said, but I think its could easily have been misinterpreted. Saying that it's the same hyrule could just mean 'the same incarnation of the world', not that it's gonna be the same map. It could take place everywhere. It could take place all underground (which could actually be pretty cool and interesting), it could take place in the sky, it could take place in the shitter of Hyrule Castle, or it could take place on the two small islands in the eastern ocean that teases the fuck out of you, but you can't get to. 

I personally think, at most, it's gonna be something like Super Mario Galaxy 2, where they gonna put in alot of unused and new idea's, but in this case, having it take place in a New setting. That way the new game can feel like a sequel, while it's predecessor, even with all its flaws, can continue to stand on it own, without being lesser.

It would also ruin both their characters (pre-established from BOTW), Zelda is shown as a character that cares more about knowledge and helping people, rather than being a dedicated fighter like Link. By this I don’t mean that she hasn’t faced Ganon (that’s what she did all game), but rather that she avoids confrontations.

And I honestly want to play as Link, being a sequel to a game which I’ve played with him for over 250 hours; Im just more attached to Link.

zelda,t3_c76czz,"[TP] A sad, but nice effect of the timeline.","After playing through TP for the first time, I was struck by one way it nicely intersected in the timeline, which was only just being considered/made official with that game's release. In TP, which takes place in the Child timeline where Ganondorf never rose to power and was arrested when OoT Link and Zelda were young, we see an unfamiliar group of Sages, identical priest-like spirits, tasked with executing him. This fails and the Sage of Water is killed. 

But in *Ocarina of Time*, I realized, *all of them were.* For the diverse group of Sages to awaken in the Adult timeline, there'd have to be an absence of existing Sages. When Ganondorf took over, he killed all of the spirit Sages from TP. This is why Saria, Darunia, Ruto, Impa, Zelda, Rauru, and Nabooru awoke. 

Kinda sad, isn't it? Sure, the TP Sages don't have the individuality or nostalgia factor that the OoT ones have, but the fact that they all had to be killed for the Sages we knew first to awaken is pretty depressing, and I like the way the timeline works to allow that.",23,public,Discussion

My restore point is in the 2D screen right before you fight the miniboss.


I tried resetting to the restore point numerous times. Doesn't work; the block won't unlock.

I tried using in-game ""Save &amp; Quit"" and restarting from the entrance of the dungeon (before AND after beating the miniboss). Doesn't work; the block won't unlock.

I tried going back to get the Small Key I need (from the room with two Mini-Moldorms) before fighting the boss, AND after. Doesn't work; the block won't unlock.

I tried pressing 'A' or 'B' with numerous different items in my 'hand'. Doesn't work; the block won't unlock.

I tried lowering the water level, because maybe the block has to be on dry land. Doesn't work; I can't even get to the key-block unless the floor is underwater.

I tried desperately begging and praying to God. Doesn't work; the block won't unlock.

With a series with as much enemy variety as Zelda, many of whom made no appearances outside one game, an excellent improvement to BOTW 2 would be returning foes adapted to the new game style. Here are some of my wants

Vires from Zelda 1. They are blue gargoyles that split into two Keese when killed, and it's almost baffling they were never used again. They would likely inhabit cliffsides and swamps, and spit fire until split: perhaps if there is fire nearby the newly split keese will attempt to light themselves.

Poes not being in is strange: they've been in many a game and have been collectibles in a few. I would rather take a picture of a Poe, use the search radar to find more, kill them and use their souls to upgrade inventory, rather than lifting rocks for korok seeds. Might fit what appears to be a darker game, too.

Perhaps the most baffling exclusion, though, are Like Likes! In a game with expendable equipment, they would consume random weapons, encouraging you to use them up. This reinforces the notion of ""use it, don't lose it"". Some of my favorite moments in the game came from the plateau, where every shot, strike, and bomb counted. Like Like's have always been very unpopular in games where you usually buy things once and never again, but in a game like BOTW, they're really natural.",12,public,Question

zelda,t3_c6ww67,[TP] I have a new favorite dungeon,"Playing TP for the first time, and I'll be honest, I started to not enjoy the dungeons after the lakebed temple, for 1 reason,  they started getting too big.  I never thought that would be an issue for me but after spending way too many hours in lakebed temple and then too many in Arbiter's Grounds and way, way too many in snowpeak; even though I like those 2 dungeons aesthetics and ideas, they just turned into a drag to get through.  That changed with the temple of time.  Even though I was stuck for a while in a certain room I think I went through it faster then the last 2. Aside from it being the right size and length, it was so much fun, the devs really outdid themselves with the puzzles here, thier so ingenious. And then once u get the dominion rod and u have to go through the dungeon's puzzles backwards while guiding the statue,  I was having zeldagasms :)  This has replaced the mining facility in SS as my favorite dungeon in the series. 

 I really felt proud of myself when I finally figured out how to get the statue across the big scale.  I didn't know the small weights could be controlled with the dominion rod, I accidentally pointed it at them, that made things a lot simpler :) Also I came the closest to dying, after not having a game over since the escort mission, twice in here, once for the Darknut mini boss and the final boss really tossed me around because it took  me forever to figure out what I was supposed to do. That happens to me a lot actually....   

I hope the next 3 dungeons more like this then the previous ones.  It was just the right length and every room was a great puzzle, no wasted time like I felt with the last 2.",6,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_c6ufxx,"Is there anything official in canon that explains the universe (or multiverse), and Link's true purpose? [ALL]","I was thinking about it as I played Breath of the Wild. Prior to BotW I've only played OoT, but i know some things about other games in the series (though it doesn't appear to be a linear series, so i hesitate to use that word). Every time, it seems that Link 'wakes up' into vaguely the same situation. 

My idea of the ""metaverse"" is that Link is literally a ""link"" between iterations in a multiverse, wherein he is the saviour figure in each iteration, or ""probability fractal"", as I would like to refer to it. 

That's why, in every iteration, the world is slightly different, aside from a few key elements.  This is even taken as far as different distinct art styles throughout the iterations. Of course,  it is probable that both a 2d and a 3d universe exists in a multiverse. And a change in art style denotes a difference in aesthetic perspective in these respective universes.  

But,  if Link is always saving universes, why is Link never done saving universes? Is there no salvation for Link? Is Link like the Buddha, who, in some stories, reached the other side, but looked back on the suffering of the world and decided that it would rather submit itself back into the suffering of the world to save it, rather than going to the other side, and freedom? 

I apologize if this is redundant, or dumb. It's my first post on this sub.

No idea what they’d do, but it beats getting used for one game and then discarded, except maybe Epona, who would be the most recurring of the lot.

Maybe the Triforce is finally being depleted from being abused for so many generations, and not only has this worn down the barriers between timelines and worlds, but because all of these characters were so close to the pieces they got pulled through to a ‘neutral’ Hyrule and it’s up to them to save it and restore everything. I dunno, I’m just spit balling here.

zelda,t3_c6sewo,[OTHER] Insane Question: Am I the only one who wants a Wand of Gamelon remake?,"No.  I'm not kidding.  Hear me out.

Everyone and their mother (and their mother's hamster) knows the disaster-piece that is the Phillips Cdi game *Zelda: Wand of Gamelon*.  It has sub-par handling, laughable cutscenes and story, confusing/misleading level design, an inconvenient button layout, and the list goes on.

But...I'm not gonna lie, I think there's a foundation for a good game in there.  I like the idea of playing as Zelda for a change.  I think the setting could be interesting if fleshed out better.  A platformer with RPG elements could be a lot of fun.  I'm also really into entering platforming segments by exploring an open map, an expansion on *Zelda II: The Adventure of Link*.  Also, I like platformers where the level design isn't just floating bricks and such; rather all surfaces are connected to something like they would be in real life (think *Donkey Kong Country Returns* compared to *New Super Mario Bros*).

Seeing as how Nintendo has been more liberal with their IPs lately, I think it'd be cool if a trusted and talented Indie team got the rights to and made a full remake of *Wand of Gamelon*.

What do you think?  Could a full remake work?  If so, how would you do it?

Cheers!

zelda,t3_c70bwy,[BotW] BotW Cut Short!,"I've played every Zelda game. I expect that I need ""extra power"" which leads me to some dungeons before I attempt (and fail) to resolve the problems of Hyrule, and then I get a second set of challenges before finally overcoming the worst evil imaginable. Instead, what I got was optional dungeons and optional Master Sword, and I could literally go from the starter zone to Ganon and finish the game in less than an hour if I know how to parry and backflip. All of the extra ""hours"" in this game involve exploring extraneous zones and completing exrtaneous quests which have no bearing on the main quest.

I kept exploring dungeons and zones expecting to carry the rewards forward to when I visit the Temple of Time to go back 100 years to the Calamity. Oops, the ToT is just clickbait for people who played OoT. The whole entire game is a giant sack of sidequests.

Here's how I think it should have gone: Link wakes up with amnesia 100 years after Calamity apocalypse and travels around hearing how he collected Champions to defeat Ganon, and using the Master Sword goes back 100 years to collect the mentioned Champions which then sets him up to defeat Ganon 100 years later. The amnesia happened because of a major stressor due to his first attempt in returning to the future after gathering the Champions, such as memory overload or narrowly avoiding death by Ganon, and he couldn't remember how to make use of the Champions/Beasts in the final conflict.

So disappointing. I dressed up like a girl to unlock sand boots which never helped me do anything.

zelda,t3_c633ks,[ALL] Link is a left handed person,"Hello people!

&amp;#x200B;

How do you like the fact, that link is actually a left handed person?

I always liked that fact. It gave him even more personality.

The only exceptions I can think of where link is right handed is in Breath of the Wild, Twilight Princess (at least the WII version) and Skyward Sword.

The reason why he is a right handed person in the latter two, I think, is due to the motion controls. To make it more like **you** are link (as the majority of humans is right handed).

But it always seemed kinda wrong to me. I dont care if I hold the wii mote in my right hand and link has his sword in his left hand.

He is like he is and I think nintendo should return to link being left handed.

Unappealing and unsettling atmosphere and visual design aside, the item gimmick wore extremely thin and was used too much, and at the last pre-boss segment, I didn't catch on to the way the fan was activated (i.e., by lowering down from the tower, and only then being able to reach a heavy pull switch in the main room with the other Clawshot. This means I dropped down through the ceiling and, finding no way to get high enough to reach the vines in the fan shaft, I backtracked for five+ tedious minutes...and failed to understand the puzzle again. Third time after several more wasted minutes was the charm, but I lost all happiness during that play session. There were no Clawshot targets close to the vines, and grabbing the vines on the pillars doesn't let you use yout second Clawshot, since Link starts climbing them.

They wouldn't put those vines in the ceiling if you weren't able to quickly go back up to solve the puzzle, right? Was I missing something or was this just awful design?",0,public,Question

zelda,t3_c64xop,[OTHER] Feelings on an urban Zelda,"Ever since I got the double clawshot in TP, I have had a very strong desire to have a cityscape Zelda where you can hookshot from building to building like spiderman. 

I love medieval Zelda, but I feel like there is enough flexibility to have one urban/steampunkish Zelda in the series. What are everyone's opinions on that?",4,public,Discussion

zelda,t3_c69kgq,Is the Hylian shield overused? [ALL],"It’s really not a huge deal but it’s something I thought about recently. There has definitely been some variations, but it seems like they always come back to that design without really building much on it. Even in games where it kinda feels out of place, like in A Link Between Worlds and the upcoming Link’s Awakening remake.

It’s not that I don’t like the design. It’s nostalgic, after all. And there are some games where it really fits, especially in Ocarina of Time (even though that’s kinda obvious haha). It matches well with Twilight Princess’s Link as well. The problem with that in that game, I think it was a missed opportunity for the Hero’s shield, both because it would’ve matched the aesthetic of the game a bit better and it would’ve supported the whole timeline better, since TP followed MM.

I really liked how in BotW that Link’s trademark shield seemed to be a simple, interchangeable circular wooden shield as well. The travelers shield is my favorite shield in the game, aesthetically speaking. It’s especially pleasing to use with the champion’s tunic. But in the new smash bros, they just gave him the Hylian shield. I guess because it’s iconic? It just feels backwards with BotW link. That game was all about defying Zelda tradition, which is immediately noticeable in Link’s design. It just feels lazy for them to use the Hylian shield for that Link. And it feels out of place with Link’s fresh design. Of course, I know the point of BotW is that you get to look however you want. You don’t even have to use a shield if you don’t want to. I was just a little let down when in SSBU they just gave him the Hylian shield, even though he had the traveler’s shield in all the art.

It’s not like I hate the shield. I mean, it’s just a shield. But I’m a little tired of it. I wish they’d bring back the hero’s shield or something in future games. It would also be cool if they brought back the OG golden shield from the ORIGINAL Zelda’s art. It’s very simple and bare, but it’d be a pretty funny reference. I feel like it also would’ve been a good idea for them to bring back the Link to the Past shield (from the art) to the Link’s Awakening remake. It would’ve been a cool callback and I feel like the simple, less jagged design would’ve fit a LOT better with the look they’re going for. Would’ve been better than just the Hylian shield again IMO. Same goes for A Link Between Worlds.

Do you guys agree?",1,public,Discussion
