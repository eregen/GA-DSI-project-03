What if in the next game we are introduced to his other son, Fenrir, the great wolf who the Odin locks up out of fear.

Now, I've got the language cipher to enter the fire realm, and I've got the resources to buy a full set of purple armour, just not upgrade all of it. Unsocketed the blue and purple sets leave me mid level 4. 
Should I stick with my current upgraded blue set for now or spend resources getting the purple set? Unsocketed the blue set has mildly better stats but either way I'm still level 4. I don't have the resources to upgrade the purple set, that'd take me to level 5 which would be a no brainier.

GodofWar,t3_caswp9,Is that Odin at the end of God of war?,So after the credits roll Kratos &amp; Loki lay down to finally get some peaceful rest. Only to be awoken by a humanoid hooded figure. Who is at this point maybe 20 feet from the front door of the home of Kratos. The hooded figure stands silently as he calls down thunder around himself. Kratos and Loki rush out of the house. Kratos then calls out to the figure‚Äù üó£WHO ARE YOU!‚Äù To which we neither you or Kratos gets an answer. Next thing you know Kratos and Loki awaken to realize that they had been sleep the entire time. I speculate that the hooded figure is Odin. This is completely his style. We have seen Odin visit people in their dreams or give them visions in broad day light. I‚Äôll use an example. Thor Ragnarok! In Thor Ragnarok Odin often visited Thor in his mind. As well as Loki. The thunder is simply a show of power. Odin being the All father has abilities such as thunder and many other abilities as well. Also is we follow true God of war fashion I believe Kratos will fight and kill all of the sons daughters and warriors of Odin before facing the all father himself. I think the next end game boss will be Thor for the next God of war series. I also believe Odin will be the end game boss after the next install of God of war. I believe the purpose of us seeing Odin use this show of power to say to Kratos I‚Äôm watching you. After this last Game this next chapter in the life of Kratos. Odin now has an eye on Kratos. Kratos has the attention of the all father and that is never a good thing. Just ask the giants.,0,public,

That should be what he originally said, but when Kratos rewinds time, right BEFORE he interferes, zeus' dialogue is now **""even now as you draw your last breath, you continue to defy me? *No matter...*""**

He was about to say something before future Kratos interrupted, but why was the dialogue different? Was it accidental or intentional? Did Zeus somehow guess that Kratos would mess with time?

Osea en el siguiente juego empieza con la pelea √©pica contra Thor que sera interrumpida o no darse por completo ya que sera la √∫ltima pelea como boss final. Kratos sera derrotado por alg√∫n factor en la primera pelea que tengan as√≠ Thor se llevara a Atreus,Kratos tendr√° que emprender camino e ira a por su hijo y al final es posible que suceda la muerte de Kratos que vimos , ya sea porque Od√≠n a manipulado a su hijo para que acabara con kratos ya que sabia que el traer√≠a el Ragnarok o ya que el mato a su hijo o algo ,dando as√≠ al 3 de la trilog√≠a, con Afrodita o Hela (que seguramente aparecer√° en este y le contara a Kratos sobre su hijo Loki quien es el padre de ella y tal para que as√≠ Loki no sepa nada y sea clave en la ecuaci√≥n esta) volviendo de alguna forma en su forma de esp√≠ritu para guiarle al camino para encontrarse con su pasado Espartano por mucho que lo haya evitado volviendo una vez mas del inframundo (aunque con no dejarlo muerto del todo y herido de gravedad o una vuelta por los infiernos n√≥rdicos en vida en plan hacer lo que tiene que hacer y para lo que naci√≥), para dar caza a Od√≠n (como Zeus de esta saga), Thor (Si es que lo dejan vivo si no) su hermano el Dios de la Venganza y algunos (semi-)dioses mas al estilo del 3 y en este s√≠ quiz√°s no sea Kratos qui√©n de el √∫ltimo golpe y acabe con Od√≠n si no ¬øLoki(Atreus)? ¬øQui√©n alomejor cuentan que la madre muere por la culpa de Od√≠n para hacer de Atreus lo que fue con Kratos en el Olimpo,ya que sab√≠a todo lo que fuera suceder? Y Que en esta 3¬™ entrega Kratos si de la vida por el, despu√©s de completar el ciclo traicionar,venganza,serenidad,ser traicionado y dando la vida olvidando la venganza y descansando en paz y que este lo resucite en un final en Fenrir y que a partir de la siguiente Trilogia si es que la hay, sea Atreus el prota quedandose con el nombre en honor a su padre por el nombre que le puso del compa√±ero ca√≠do en Grecia (dejando atr√°s el de Loki) ¬øy que Kratos sea el Lobo que nos acompa√±ara en los siguientes juegos? 

&amp;#x200B;

 Y que por ejemplo una siguiente Saga en la mitolog√≠a Japonesa por eso de ser ¬øGigante,Mortal y Dios?,Cielo,Tierra y Inframundo? o Egipcia y que trate de buscar el Ankh la llave de la vida esa la reliquia del Crash, para revivir a su padre , ¬øpero ahora carrileando √©l?, contra dioses como Ra,Isis,Anubis,Thoth,Osiris y Am√≥n (como Od√≠n/Zeus)...? .La Celta no se porque pero me viene que seria el siguiente y solamente de ATREUS sin acompa√±amiento, para que se le coja cari√±o al personaje ya que no se por eso del dios de los animales y eso,que sea su Grecia que fue para Kratos,para que as√≠ se prepare para alguna de las otras 2.   

&amp;#x200B;

O otra opci√≥n y si Tyr es Atreus (loki del futuro) por eso de ser el dios de la guerra n√≥rdico y que evitara por completo todas las guerras al contrario de su padre ya que le intento ense√±ar eso, pasando asi a Atreus de esta linea temporal resucitando a Loki en Fenrir (la imagen que se ve de alguien muy parecido a Kratos sin un brazo que en realidad es Atreus del futuro (Tyr) con la falda escocesa de su paso por la cultura Celta que se vera en el siguiente juego?) con esta variante tiene sentido que lo dicho anterior suceda para que el hijo fuera a la cultura Celta despu√©s de la muerte de Kratos para buscar respuestas, lo √∫nico que estar√≠a fuera es que Kratos fuera el lobo,el estar√≠a muerto pues hasta que consiguiera Atreus resucitarlo en la cultura Egipcia y as√≠ el dando un √∫ltimo rodeo por la Japonesa (dando un Fan Service de toda la franquicia brutal, con un poquito de todo).   

&amp;#x200B;

PD: Dicho as√≠ parece un refrito de la primera Saga pero con mas profundidad de personaje y la excusa para la venganza jaja aunque ojala fuera as√≠ la verdad me rentaria jajaja es que sabiendo que el creador le encanto la serie cancelada de Star Wars es capaz de hacer un (Palpat√≠n) Od√≠n dando mas profundidad a todo, no tan vac√≠o como la primera saga.   jajajajaj sorry por la paja mental que me mont√© demasiado l√≠o.Aunque si alguien quiere hacer animaci√≥n,o un gui√≥n ya que quieren hacer la pel√≠cula llamad a este numero : xDDDD

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here my theory of the sequel,

When they teach us the supposed spoiler of Kratos' death ... what if he does not die in that scene? Bone in the next game begins with the epic fight against Thor that will be interrupted or not given completely as it will be the last fight as boss final. Kratos will be defeated by some factor in the first fight they have so Thor will take Atreus, Kratos will have to take the road and go after his son and in the end it is possible that the death of Kratos that we saw will happen, either because Odin has manipulated to his son to finish with kratos because he knew that he would bring the Ragnarok or since he killed his son or something, thus giving the 3 of the trilogy, with Aphrodite or Hela (who will surely appear in this and tell Kratos about her son Loki who is her father and so that Loki does not know anything and is key in the equation) returning in some way in his spirit form to guide him on the road to meet his Spartan past no matter how much I have avoided returning once again from the underworld (although not leaving him dead at all and seriously wounded or a return to the Nordic hells in life in plan to do what he has to do and what he was born), to hunt down Odin ( as Zeus of this saga), Thor (If it is left alive if not) his brother the God of Vengeance and some (semi-) gods more like the 3 and in this yes maybe it is not Kratos who of the last blow and kill Odin if not Loki (Atreus)? Who could possibly say that the mother dies because of Odin's fault to make Atreus what it was with Kratos in Olympus, since he knew everything that was going on? And that in this 3rd installment Kratos if life for him, after completing the cycle betray, revenge, serenity, betrayed and giving life forgetting revenge and resting in peace and that this resuscitated him in a final in Fenrir and that from the following Trilogy if there is one, Atreus is the prota staying with the name in honor of his father by the name he gave him of the fallen companion in Greece (leaving behind Loki's) and that Kratos is the Wolf that will accompany us in the following games?

&amp;#x200B;

And that for example a following Saga in Japanese mythology for that reason to be ""Giant, Mortal and God ?, Heaven, Earth and Underworld? or Egyptian and try to find the Ankh the key to life that the relic of the Crash, to revive his father, but now racking him ?, against gods like Ra, Isis, Anubis, Thoth, Osiris and Amun (as Odin /Zeus)...? The Celta do not know why but I think it would be the next and only ATREUS unaccompanied, so that you take love to the character and that is not why the god of animals and that, that is his Greece that was for Kratos , so that it is prepared for one of the other 2.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Or another option and if Tyr is Atreus (loki of the future) because of being the god of the Nordic war and who completely avoided all wars as opposed to his father as I try to teach that, thus passing to Atreus of this line temporarily resuscitating Loki in Fenrir (the image that is seen of someone very similar to Kratos without an arm that is actually Atreus of the future (Tyr) with the kilt of its passage through the Celtic culture that will be seen in the next game? ) with this variant it makes sense that the previous thing happened so that the son went to the Celtic culture after the death of Kratos to look for answers, the only thing that would be out is that Kratos was the wolf, he would be dead then until he got Atreus resuscitate it in the Egyptian culture and thus giving a final detour by the Japanese (giving a Fan Service of the whole brutal franchise, with a little bit of everything).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Said so it seems a rehash of the first Saga but with more depth of character and the excuse for revenge haha ‚Äã‚Äãalthough hopefully it would be true that I would rent hahaha is that knowing that the creator loved the canceled Star Wars series is capable of make a (Palpat√≠n) Od√≠n giving more depth to everything, not as empty as the first saga.

NG+ First new game+ carrying over from gmgow
Just chopped mimirs head and went straight to muspelheim without reviving him

1. I watched videos and I manually saved the game in the travel room. I exit it and receive no skap slag and then once I exit broke shop, which is right after travel room, I recieved the sklag* and exp for visiting muspelheim. 
I reload the game and it starts again in travel room but I dont keep the 9 sklag I got from first save.
I'm guessing that they patched this by recieving sklag from exiting broken shop instead of exiting travel room as most videos show that u receive it after exiting travel room. 
Thoughts?

2. I unlocked the gem of mine enchantment in purple rarity (forgot the name) and was wondering, shouldnt I had received the perfect version? In my last run, I didnt unlock it as I wasnt aware of this missable item.

For the record I tried:
Loading older saves
Checked my inventory to see if I already layed it down.
Have made sure im not missing any valkyries
It's not in the lost items, because it literally can't end up there. 

P.s. I was on normal mode, and approached them after I beat the game. But, the valkyries were all way easier then I thought based on the reactions to them on here. I killed half of them on my first try. Their move patterns are really similar, and honestly if you just put a fuck ton of pressure on them it boils down to the same fight each time. I hope there are optional bosses like this In the sequel, but I hope they are way harder, and the regular bosses are as hard as the valkyries (not queen) in this one. Goodbye GOW(2018) it was a lot of fun, and then you ripped it all away.

GodofWar,t3_c9eacg,The woman,"Kratos looks off into the distance. The snow-covered mountains before him stretching for miles. He inhales the crisp air and then turns to the woman beside him, ""What is this place?"" The woman doesn't answer and instead produces an ornate vial. She gestures for Kratos to drink from it and puts the vial to his lips. Despite never having met the woman, Kratos somehow feels at ease in her presence. He takes a sip from the vial then pushes it from his lips. The woman follows suit.
""Welcome to Midgard?"" she speaks, as if to test the potion's efficacy. Kratos is surprised to hear the woman's voice. It is unexpectedly pleasant. ""We should make our acquaintances before this potion wears off,"" she continues candidly. There is something in her voice that almost makes Kratos smile. He keeps quiet as the woman walks closer to him. ""I am Laufey, one of the last of my people, and I know a great deal about you and your past, Ghost of Sparta."" The look on Kratos' face shifts and he promptly turns from the woman. ""You know of me?"" he asks concerned. ""I do,"" she affirms as she returns his gaze to hers. ""...and yet, here we are."" Again the comfort of her voice puts him at ease. They linger for a while before Kratos breaks the silence, ""Why bring me here... to this place?"" 
""Midgard?"" she asks, not shifting her gaze from his. ""For one thing, it's safe. No one will come looking for you here."" Her hands graze Kratos' arms where the chains were once seared to his flesh. ""These do not heal at all,"" she remarks concerned. Kratos grunts and pulls his arms from her hands. ""I have made sacrifices and for that I have paid the price."" he responds while tightening the rags covering the scars. ""Cursed"" she remarks almost callously.

GodofWar,t3_c9jd13,Roger Clark for Thor in the next game?,"I'm new to Reddit, so bear with me guys.

I've just finished the latest God of War, I've been a fan of the series since the very first one and absolutely loved this game. I was so impressed by it. After finishing it I immediately looked to see if a sequel was in the works or had been announced because I'm so interested in where the story will go next. 

I saw the message someone decoded from the PS4 anniversary theme and the tweets from Cory Barlog himself regarding ""Ragnarok is coming"" and with Thor obviously being mentioned and referred to in God of War. It then got me thinking on who could play Thor in a sequel game. They've already got a very solid cast from this game and the actor who sprung to my mind immediately was Roger Clark. He's burst out onto the scene with critical acclaim and I think he would fit the role of Thor perfectly. I think the depth he would bring to Thor would be stunning.

GodofWar,t3_c953r7,New Kratos wouldn't make sense without good ol' annoying Kratos,"Although I got the game a year ago, I left it nearly at the beginning. I felt this wasn't GoW. Gameplay was different, atmosphere different. Even found Atreus annoying. Heck, I really missed Terrance Carson's voice. Then, I saw an article that Santa Monica Studios was about to cut out Kratos from GoW because he was annoying. Annoying! Can you believe it? Of course, they didn't and they're happy with the result. So I decided to give it another chance these last couple of weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh boy, what a ride.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't wrong about my first impressions: Kratos is not the furious god I loved to play with in the previous installments. But why should he be? Ultimately, he got his revenge and killed everyone in its path. Now, without the rage there's only remorse. The way he hides his chain scars from Atreus was the first sign of this. But the character development is gold: through out the game you can see how the patience of Kratos goes from 0 to 100. His kindness towards Atreus from -100 to 1000. He even joked around with Mimir. Kratos smiling!

&amp;#x200B;

There are many powerful moments, but the one that really moved me was when they were in Helheim and the image of Kratos was about to kill Zeus appears. The few times I've seen Kratos so defeated and ashamed like that moment were when they showed how he murdered his first wife and daughter. Maybe he was thinking how to explain the situation to Atreus. In turn, Atreus was like 'ok, I see it. No biggie.' Maybe he didn't understand the situation (he's an 8 year old boy, after all), but I felt that for Kratos was a great relief that Atreus didn't judged him. The love of a son.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end, they are a bonded team and Kratos is even capable of express his feelings freely, other than fury, of course. I would've never  imagined that in the old Kratos. In fact, GoW as a standalone is great. The development of father and son relationship is palpable, but having in mind the ""annoying"" Kratos was just yelling, killing and fu... fornicating mindlessly makes even deeper the change of the new Kratos. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I feel that the logical step for the sequel is that Kratos gets killed in the first part of the game (and not by his son). Why? Because he's redeemed himself and would make a proper transition for Atreus (Loki) to be the new gods slayer. In fact, I think that the proper title would be Ragnarok, without ""God of War"". But that's a topic for another post.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is: What a master piece!

&amp;#x200B;

I already have Ivaldis cursed set at base level, none upgraded. I have the 2 things to do immediately:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Get 2 more anchor of fog - I was lucky to have full rage, do 2 'rooms' before hitting the open field and being lucky yet again to have Ogre enemy type to destroy that field easy. Opening the chest gave me anchor of fog. I need 2 more, my question is, should I either just run through the rooms and go for the 'field' to kill enemies and hope I get anchor of fog or should I do the first 2 rooms and then do the field? I know the chance increases if u have opened chests earlier but does that mean there still might be a chance to get anchor of fog without actually doing the first 2 rooms? Even if its 1 in 25 or 50, is there a chance?  Sometimes I am just not able to beat 2 rooms for some reason, GmGOW doesn't allow walk in the parks. And this is my first playthrough so it also means that I am Lvl 8 at most without the top armor upgraded yet.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Max out Ivaldi's set - Not talking about other resources required that arn't in Nippl...Niflheim, what is the best way to get haze weave at first (since its low in availability for me) and then aesirbane? Should I do the maze (4 rooms) and hope I get from some chests or should I do everything, including 2 fields as well? Im on GmGOW and I can at most do 2 rooms and 3rd field/room if I got some rage meter built up.   My main issue also arises from the fact that things dont die so quick for me. What weapons you suggest I use? I have both of them maxed and I start off by doing runic attacks to let them sit on a cooldown but I can do 2 rooms at most, 3 if the enemies are easy. But the field room has tough enemies for me lol. GmGOW just makes things ridiculously hard. It took me 4 days to beat Sigrun.

I think I missed a key piece of info in the whole time travel story with the serpent.

Now that we've learned that Atreus (Loki) is J√∂rmungandr's father (as long as the game doesn't stray from this aspect of Norse Mythology), when would the serpent have been born? It would have to be before Ragnarok, right?

Sadly GoW does not allow some choice in that department. You're locked for good on the hardest one.

Having started on Give Me a Challenge and knowing how hard the first enemies of the game are, I was wondering if they become 'bullet sponges' and if so, the difficulty is artificially upped by increasing their HP and damage, without adding new flair to the gameplay.

GodofWar,t3_c7sn97,I enjoy my second playthrough a lot more,"I grew up with the first two games on ps2 and absolutely loved them to death.I switched to pc gaming before the ps3 came out, but then decided to move back on console.I owned a xbox one for most of this generation mostly because I got it stupidly cheap, and god damn did I regret that decision.It just wasn't for me, I like single player games and the ps4 exclusives were killing me.When god of war was announced I finally couldn't take it anymore, I started saving money and by the time it came out I had enough for the console and about five or six exclusives(one of them was the remaster of gow3 which I missed)

Gow3 was everything I wanted it to be, I just can't describe the feeling it game me, it was like being a kid again.Non stop action, and the boss fights were unbelievable.This got me even more excited for the new one, especially the ending that hinted to the new direction of Kratos


However..it didn't clicked with me the way I was expecting.Don't get me wrong, I still loved it, but it didn't blew my mind or anything like that, it wasn't a perfect 10 for me.The new camera angle felt wierd, the new Kratos felt wierd, the lack of QTE action(which I know a lot of people hate but I actually really like it lol),very few epic bosses, and having a freaking kid with me all the time, it all felt a bit wierd.The kid grew on me eventually and so did most of the things I mentioned but it still missed something, I really don't know what it was.I obviously shit my pants at that special scene(you know which one) but that was about it.


The wierd thing is that after about a month I found myself thinking back to the game.Like it left a mark on me.I was just randomly remembering parts of it and going ""hmm maybe that wasn't so bad"", ""yeah that dragon fight was actually really fucking cool"", etc.This went on for sooo long, but I was also going through a rough period then, so I said this time I will wait for the right moment and give it a proper second chance.


Three days ago I felt it was the right moment, I was actually more excited than the first time for some reason, and after two hours of playing I had to take a break and figure out what the hell was wrong with me the first time.It's not uncommon for me to like something more the second time, but never on this scale.EVERYTHING was amazing, the music, the acting, the gameplay, so many details I missed the first time.I got goosebumps all over my body when they burned Faye at the beginning, legit goosebumps for a character that is never even shown.That was the scene that made me realize how good the music is, and I played the rest of the game with headphones.I can go on and on describing everything I love now and didn't the first time but this post is already getting too long.I have about a quarter of the story left and I'm seriously considering starting a third playthrough(NG+ this time) right after this one, just because I spend half of this one wondering how could I be so blind.Oh and I'm also getting the platinum for sure.


And one last thing.It felt so good last night to barely be able to fall asleep due to excitement to play again.I don't even remember the last time I felt this.

GodofWar,t3_c7dpi2,The real reason Kratos keeps being called a God and not a Demi-God...,"Is because he became a full god at the end of God of War 3. Think about it, the Blade of Olympus drained his divinity, so it could have been possible to give it back. We just saw an extreme, maybe only, way of doing it. He stabbed himself with the blade in order to release the power of Hope to the world, but I strongly believe that in exchange the divine power that belonged to Kratos returned to his body. Kratos didn‚Äôt notice at the time cause he was bleeding out and then decided to take a dip in the ocean. By the time he came to on the shore of Norway where coincidently his Original blades washed up. Kratos was like ‚Äúhuh I definitely feel more godly than last week, not that I care or anything‚Äù. 

So in summary the other half of Kratos divine power left the sword and went back into him whilst Hope was released. 

I consider it to be a reward and curse for the actions he took in the trilogy. He rid the world of a corrupt and cruel pantheon but at the cost of the land he grew up in. And if he hates all Gods, by being one it gives him more reason to hate himself. Granted I‚Äôm sure he already did deep down, but he was in his ‚Äúi will have my revenge‚Äù phase. Now he hates himself but loved his second wife and loves his BOI.",397,public,Spoilers
GodofWar,t3_c7r2bn,TIFU by not saving my sister's playthrough of God of War before gloating about my endgame build,"I know, I'm in the wrong subreddit but i think this would be a better fit here than anywhere else.

My younger sister is a noob and this was her first god of war playthrough. She's been playing on my ps4 account and she played for a week to get halfway through to the ""Return to the summit"" quest. I watched through her playthrough being an absolute knob of a backseat gamer and finally lamented on the state of her armor. Taught her a couple tricks to build her level up for the later stages and she asked me what level i had finished on. So i tell her, I'll show you and I proceed to load up my endgame build.

I showed her the level 8 build i had and gave her a chance to go through the motions in niflheim and proceeded to go out for stuff. Once i got back home, she was screaming and hysterical. I found out that she had never manual saved her game and the moment she played on my save game, her autosaves were deleted. I felt bad about it and offered her I'd play a new playthrough up to the point she left off at to make up for my mistakes. She finally relents and here I am now, 5 sessions in and done with half the game.

The replayability on this game is soo good and the cut scenes were so epic as any god of war game should be, I ended up probably enjoying it much more than I intended. I did manual save it this time and I'm thinking of just creating another save to finish off this playthrough. But then again, I might give newgame+ a go next time.

TLDR: Sister never manual saved game and i loaded my playthrough thereby deleting the autosaves. Had to replay god of war till her progress and had fun all over again.",7,public,

I took notice of her phrase saying that the desolation  ""...is a symbol of a world out of balance."" I believe that this refers to the destruction of the Greek Pantheon. 

As we all know, gods in the GoW universe are real, and that every ""land"" has their own pantheon. According to GoW, there are four main pantheons, the Greek, the Egyptian, the Norse and lastly the Japanese mythologies evidenced by the panel in Tyr's temple in Hel. 

Without the Greek pantheon, the GoW Earth is essentially out of balance because I presume that these pantheons are essential for creating and maintaining reality as is.

2) In the Light of Alfheim, one of the sequences has Kratos on a shore walking into a cave. Facing the shore is the Thor statue. Thor's statue doesn't face a shore normally, so this is obviously deliberate. But the shore also has a track in the ground leading from the water to the cave. We can only assume it's from the boat there, but maybe not. The fish flopping about would also suggest the water level went down again?

mantaining&gt;! blades of chaos!&lt; and axe while adding other 2 weapons or 3. (such as a spear, 2 handed sword,  daggers) with other types of elements in them ( such as blue lightning)and different flow in gameplay mechanics and combat.

making legendary and epic armour waist slot also cover/ change the appearence from foot to legs.

Robert Oppenheimer after he helped create the atomic bomb. ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"". I did some googling and found that Oppenheimers relative worked on the game, and this quote is also present in GoW2 as an Easter egg.

GodofWar,t3_c6cpam,My take on the future of the game,"I believe it's all connected and every little bit is going to affect the future.
- Ragnarok has already started and according to norse mythology, Thor will be killed by the serpent's venom, which is embedded in the leviathan axe after the first encounter between kratos and the serpent. So kratos is going to kill thor and thor kratos.
- Loki is the father of the serpent, Hel and Fenrir. The last is the wilf that kills Odin and also the mother of skoll and hati bringers of day and night. So in essence, these giants children of Loki are therr before Loki was born. Meaning that there was another timeline in which Atreus birthed them and sent them back in time, a perfect and smart plan illustrating the godly power of Loki. And I believe the serpent did not go back in time because of this powerful fight with Thor, he was sent by Loki and the reason he hates thor is because Thor kills his grandpa basically.
The Loki of the first timeline had planned all of this. This is the timeline in which victory happens. With all, of this in mind, I, also think Atreus from the first timeline blew the horn (plus he knew when his young self and his dad would be too busy with the sickness to either see it or give a Damn) 
- Concerning the valkeries, they will basically make sure non of the soldiers of the hall of valhalla would be of threat to kratos and atreus.

One key thing happens in Ragnorok and that is Odin and The World Serpent fight and it shakes the world tree so hard that the world serpent gets sent back in time? A few things...
1. Does the other gods and people get sent back in time because the world serpent said that he recognized Atreus but he is only what 9,10,11 years old? So was there an older atreus Loki already or what?? Sorry if I don't get that!
2. I guess I heard Mimir say that Odin was after the giants because he wanted to predict his fate of Ragnorok but it had to have already happened since the world serpent recognized atreus already right? So Odin knows he Is gonna die but in the mythology it says a new God or gods cant remember, so has it already happened or not or has it happened numerous times??

GodofWar,t3_c6bsre,The Ghost of Spardas faith theory (Spoilers included),"So I am sure at this point we have all played and completed the series as a whole at this point(or at very least the new game). What I wanna discuss is what Kratos' faith will be in the next game. 
As we know Kratos will for die at some point so Atreaus can ascend to become his best self. What some people might not know in regards to mythology is that Loki was always the one who basically killed Balder, started Ragnarok and was responsible for the end of the gods. Before Ragnarok there is the long winter which lasts about 3 years ( it states three long winters which I'm taking as years so they can age Loki a bit). After which we will see an older and more trained Atreaus, but one that is still learning the Spartan ways. 
Anyways I think before he meets his final faith Kratos will have to confess to killing his family(his daughter his wife, his sister and his father), and how he threw the world into the disrepair. How he is the ghost of Sparta, and he can never be the parent Atreus deserves. 
Kratos will die, handing the torch (blades) over to Loki and give us a final game with Loki looking for revenge against Odin who will have no doubt killed Kratos.",0,public,

GodofWar,t3_c61pom,Speculation/Predicting Major Plot Points of the Next Game,"Hi all, this is my first post!  
 (LARGE SPOILERS AHEAD)

  
So I've been finding out information about the original descriptions of Ragnarok and it appears that unless the key events of Ragnarok are adjusted, Kratos may not get to defeat as many of the main gods in the same way he did with the Greek pantheon. Specifically, Thor and Odin, two characters who seem to be the most likely choices for main antagonists of the next installment in the franchise, would die of causes other than combat with Kratos and Atreus.  
   
It is mentioned that Jormangandr and Thor will both kill each other in an epic battle, which is gonna be incredible to witness, and also super sad cause I love Jormangandr!  Also, as written, Odin is eaten by Fenrir, which means Kratos wouldn't be able to kill him, and Loki dies fighting Heimdall, whom we have yet to see in the franchise, though his horn is a collectible item. 

  
So what do you think? Will we see Ragnarok as written or will Kratos kill many gods who would have died otherwise in combat with other Norse gods? Will Atreus and possibly even Kratos die? Let me know your thoughts and I hope this gets some good conversation going.

Update: I think I might have sent the wrong message the way this was originally phrased. I am completely fine with Santa Monica Studios changing the mythos for the sake of story! If they totally change things up I think it would probably work in the game‚Äôs favor by giving more authority to Kratos and ultimately the player.",2,public,

GodofWar,t3_c5pn4v,Why is Sindri‚Äôs name ‚ÄúAtri/Atree‚Äù in Neil Gaimans book ‚ÄúNorse Mythology‚Äù?,"Another huge fanboy here who‚Äôs freakishly/ridiculously obsessed with Kratos and the entire God of War story! Played every game multiple times, read all the novels that have been written, bought all the digital comics, named my dog after him, many GoW toys around the house which my fianc√© hates, blah blah blah Blades of Chaos are the greatest weapons ever invented blah blah...

I wanted to ask this question about a year ago, but totally forgot until I was flying home from a trip last weekend and decided to re-listen to Neil Gaimans ‚ÄúNorse Mythology‚Äù book on my audiobook account. 

One of the first stories he talks about is concerning how Thor got his hammer (along with 5 other largely important items in the Norse mythology world), and the epic crafting battle between the Sons of Ivaldi vs Brok and ‚ÄúAtri/Atree‚Äù...not Brok and Sindri, as they were introduced to us in the new God of War game. I understand that Santa Monica isn‚Äôt following the mythology ‚Äúby the book‚Äù, but they also don‚Äôt do anything without meaning behind it...so when I noticed the name change in the book from the video game, it got me wondering. 

Is Sindri a character in Norse Mythology that we don‚Äôt know about yet? He wasn‚Äôt mentioned by Neil Gaiman anywhere in his stories, so it‚Äôs very odd to me that Santa Monica would change one of the most famous dwarf brothers in this mythology UNLESS there was a reason for this which will reveal itself to us in future games? Or maybe I‚Äôm looking too deep into this, but even though they‚Äôre playing with the storyline of Norse mythology, all the major players seem to be the same except for this Sindri/Atri name...

I know they combined Frey and Freyas character into being one person, they‚Äôve killed off characters who are supposed to survive Ragnarok, and the whole point of GoW games is that Kratos changes everything ‚Äúthat‚Äôs supposed to happen‚Äù...but this seems a little too dramatic of a name change to not be significant IMO.

- For best results it is advised to wait until you get Mimir's head before acquiring or completing any sidequests.

[ ] Mimir on Baldur
- Must fast travel back to Brok's Shop twice before activating the horn after reviving Mimir's head, will trigger after the discussion about Freya spitting in Mimir's face and Kratos tells him to speak of Baldur instead. The next Realm Between Realms travel should trigger it, will need to boat to any realm travel point on the map. Another conversation should trigger while in the boat heading towards the travel point that talks about the spitting again. Should trigger after that while in the Realm Between Realms before using the Horn in the A New Destination quest. Will likely not trigger after this quest, or as late as after The Magic Chisel.

[ ] On Magni and Modi
- Should trigger upon travelling the Realm Between Realms after triggering Mimir on Baldur. Should trigger in there before using the horn and finishing A New Destination Quest. Will not trigger after The Magic Chisel quest, and possibly after A New Destination.

[ ] Baldur and Odin
- Triggers at the next Realm Between Realms travel as early as before finishing A New Destination and as late as before entering Tyr's Temple in The Black Rune quest. Might need to listen to Mimir's stories in the boat first, they trigger if you wait a bit and then move the boat.

[ ] Odin and Jotunheim

GodofWar,t3_c5agxe,My Thoughts; A Retroactive Second Impression,"I don't do these for games I didn't want to like. If I know I won't like a game, I don't play it, and if I wanted to like a game but don't, then I end up even more gravely disappointed. Such is the case with God of War 2018. I've only ever done this style of impressions thread on Reddit twice before, with Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, and Devil May Cry 3. In Short, God of War has many merits; the great production values, cinematic presentation, top-notch animations outstanding character dynamics, rigorous, bass endorsed sound design, jaw-dropping environments, a scintillating color palette and a near endless creativity. Yet, all of this becomes null from the disjointed, dysfunctional gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the game Day 1, and beat it on Balanced. At the time, I liked it for a little while, but the game dragged on for me at the end and I became anxious to just complete it already. By the time the game ended, I was lukewarm on it and basically just forgot about it. Whilst looking for other games to play on my Ps4 because all I play on it are Sekiro and Resident Evil 4, with Furi thrown in there for good measure, I decided to give this game another try and see what it has to offer in terms of mechanics. I play all my games with headphones as close to my TV as comfortably possible, so I judge all my games from the same baseline.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I want to re-iterate that I wanted to like this game, and I have given it more than its fair share of chances. I also realize that while the gameplay may not meet my standard par, the more abstract features of the game are excellent and deserve their praise. However, I will be focusing solely on mechanics since I have a bias for pure gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

When we think of gameplay, most people think combat. The reason for this is because combat is the most involved form of gameplay, and as such, combat can quite literally make or break a game, even if everything else is fine. This is due to the nature of the interactivity, which is different from the passive nature of watching a bad movie. You can forgive a bad movie for wasting your precious, passive time, but bad combat is hard to forgive because it's interactive, and inherently more investing from the player. Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about my biggest gripe with the game:

&amp;#x200B;

**COMBAT**

&amp;#x200B;

Combat in this game is quite literally a mess, but why? Well, it's an amalgam of different gameplay facets that do not mesh well together. I played this second playthrough on New Game+ and on Challenge mode and the cracks make their name on this difficulty. I see many people say this game was inspired by Dark Souls, but was that really a good idea? Does everything have to be like Dark Souls? I like the Soulsborne games, but definitely not for their combat. Their combat meets par, and that's it, but it works because the entire game was designed with its mechanics in mind, just like how in Resident Evil 4 the camera is positioned more crudely than in GoW, but it functions because the enemies were designed to accomodate the camera. You never feel like you're fighting the systems in these games, but it always feels that way in GoW.

&amp;#x200B;

*Movement -* Kratos has weak mobility options in the game. He has a dodge and a roll, of which will be spammed pretty much constantly while avoiding fray in the battlefield. That's not a good implementation of side-step movement because it's not psychological game design. The feeling of a well-timed button press is unprecedented (in games, ofc), but in GoW, you will hammer buttons non-stop at the expense of no reward other than 'the encounter is done, pat yourself on the back'. I don't like this because the encounters themselves don't feel rewarding during battle, and as such, I only feel relief when the battle is over. The game loves to make the player 'feel' powerful from the cool animations and things like Spartan Rage, but these are just a strong coat of paint on a faulty core.

&amp;#x200B;

*Positioning -* Going back to Movement for a bit, Kratos also has a skill from with the back dodge R1 the sends him further back while throwing the axe. This can be considered a mobility option, but it doesn't work because positioning in this game is non-existent so BOTH you and the ENEMY have *move assist.* The enemy can start an animation from 6 meters away, and suddenly slide all the way to Kratos like the arena turned into a hockey ring. This completely negates the importance of positioning in action games and is another reason why this game needs a gameplay overhaul for the sequel.

&amp;#x200B;

*Camera -* I'm no stranger to bad camera angles as long as they're accommodated for the encounter designs. Do you know what GoW's accommodation is? Some arrows in the bottom of the screen. I cannot believe people defend this because this is quite literally **amateur** combat design. The developers themselves don't even know what they want the player to focus on.

&amp;#x200B;

*Identity -* This games lacks an identity of its own in the gameplay. You look at other great action games and one can immediately deduce what their purpose for existing is; it's quite philosophical. Bayonetta - Dodge offset; Devil May Cry - Combo Showcase; Vanquish - movement and cancels; Nioh - Stances and Ki Flux, etc.. GoW's purpose is.... to tell an interactive story. In terms of gampelay, it has no purpose. It feels like the devs got together and focused on what some trendy gameplay facets are popular in AAA gaming, decided to put those in their game and hope it would mesh, whilst keeping their cinematic vision in tact.

&amp;#x200B;

*Difficulty Design -* The faulty systems in place that create a disjointed combat. Let me provide an example of a game that is even harder, yet is still a replayable masterpiece that I've sunk 1000hrs into. This game is Ninja Gaiden 2 on Master Ninja difficulty. That game is a literal to-do list of how NOT to design difficulty, but even in the wake of that, I still find myself coming back to the game ON THAT DIFFICULTY over and over again. Why? Because the game's systems are so focused, so efficient, that I can't help but play it. In fact, I feel like the unfairness actually gives the game a certain charm, due to its unpredictability keeping the combat dynamic absolutely timeless. Even though that game has the balls to stack the deck against you every chance it can, it knows your deck is strong enough to handle it. GoW has no such deck. This is why the higher difficulties are an exercise in arduousness. I'm not giving NG2 a pass for being poorly designed difficulty, I'm giving it a pass because its systems are so good that it can afford to be unfair, and even benefit from it at times. GoW has no such luxury. GoW 2's higher difficulties need to focus on **FLOW** before anything else, as that is much more important for this kind of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

*Enemy Design -* in terms of visual designs, they are incredible, but in terms of function, they all behave the same. They are all tackled so similarly, that it becomes a formality. Not to mention the lack of variety in the enemy designs. I don't mind a lack of variety as long as the A.I. demonstrate the qualities necessary in present to carry the lack of variety, but they don't. Revenants are the one enemy in the game that dared to do something different, and people seem to hate them. Goes to show that devs just can't win sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, this game gets many things right. Its animations are stellar, the world design and environments are unmatched, the color palette is vibrant, sound design is phenomenal, character dynamics are interesting, the dialogue is outstanding (it's a SCRIPT!), and many, many more great things about the game. Unfortunately, for someone like me who values gameplay above everything, I could not get into this game even though I really wanted to. The disjointed mish-mash of different, contradicting ideas end up creating a mess that I have to clean. It seems people forgive these flaws simply because the coat of paint is so strong, it practically carries the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the sequel improves on the gameplay, because this series can truly be more than just a great script and great environments, it can be a **great game, too,** and that's what I wish to see for the next installment.",1,public,

GodofWar,t3_c53uh4,Recommended difficulty for nearing the end of the story and valkyries,"Not sure if I'm actually nearing the end, but it sure feels like it. Spoilers tag just in case. I've just brought the Jotunheim tower back from the ""realm between realms.""

Basically, I've struggled with finding a comfortable but fun difficulty the entire time throughout the game. I started off on challenge mode, and I quickly got tired of being two-shotted by heavy draugr and revenants while also having to pay attention to the many smaller enemies running around, so I lowered it to balanced mode a little while after lowering the water level the first time. Since then, it's just felt way too easy. I had trouble with that one valkyrie that constantly flies up in the air and stomps your face in, but other than that I don't think I've died a single time. I did change to ""give me a story"" mode so I could farm muspelheim and niflheim, but as soon as I finished upgrading their respective armors I went back up to balanced mode, only to find that the game is even easier than before since I have pretty much maxed level gear (for now, at least). So I'm thinking of moving back up to challenge mode, but at the same time I dread those early game memories of dying countless times just to get through that one draugr gauntlet as soon as you fall through the bridge after leaving home.

Advice? Tips? What are the endgame bosses like? (Without spoilers) I know the final valkyrie is supposed to be hell, but hard boss fights are fun to me. 

I stop enjoying myself when I have to juggle 1-2 big guys capable of 2-shotting me along with some smaller enemies and a few others chucking fireballs at me. That's more obnoxious and unbearable than it is fun, imo.

Anyhow, what're your story and gameplay predictions? I think for one thing that Odin will be teased and it'll be a terrifying sequence. It'd be scary because we only see things from Kratos and Atreus' perspective. So we know about Odin only though stories, and he's a sadistic and powerful god from what's been told. Imagine if he pops up unexpectedly and is very taunting and intimidating. And Kratos and Atreus have to escape from him or something. I think that'd be great. Also Mimir is totally getting a new body.

GoW was never Shakespeare but it wasnt Transformers either.  I've loved the GoW series since 2005 and don't care for when people say that the series was just mindless violence, but GoW (2018) felt like a natural and earned progression of Kratos' character.

-When you toss Mimir's head to Brok before walking up the stairs to Jotunheim, Kratos has the slightest smirk on his face in knowing he's somewhat torturing Mimir. 

-Whenever there's a pivotal moment of dialogue between two characters (Kratos and Freya primarily), there's something between them that highlights the moment. When Freya tells Kratos she knows he's a god, Atreus is trying to pick herbs up to heal Hildisvini. Between them when they talk before the final battle with Baldur is Thamur's bracelet (with a word I can't translate) and that highlights something between the scene. But I have zero clue what it is or what it means.

-When Freya gives Kratos the travel rune to Helheim, the camera closes in on her face. It looks like her face is being sucked dry. Almost sickly. Clearly throughout the game she's getting darker tattoos on her maybe through her use of magic. Her fingertips, her arms and shoulders. But her face looking like it was draining was important.

-In a scroll, while looking for Andvari's hammer, he talks about his Soul Eater project. Apparently Surtr has Soul Eaters in his personal use, brought to them by his own personal request. And Andvari is terrified at what Surtr may be using them for.

-Early in the game, Atreus yells at Kratos asking why a fire troll would burn mother's garden. We haven't seen many fire trolls in the game but APPARENTLY Faye and the trolls knew each other. Barlog mentioned that they wanted the trolls to have their own fleshed out lore but time and space constraints didn't allow it. Odin and Tyr had made an arrangement between each other and apparently the trolls got lost in the mix (this is by Barlog's admission). It ended with almost the pure genocide of the troll tribes. Which explains why their first instinct is to attack. Because fuck everyone.

-Athena is a figment of Kratos's imagination. I'd call it PTSD but that's a rather loaded term. Mimir says ""well I'm pretty sure you weren't talking to me back there. Anything you'd like to get off your chest, brother?"" Which I think is the team's way if saying ""we're gonna deal with his past as much as we need to"". I take it to mean Athena isn't going to play an equivalent role in Norse myths as she did in Greek myths. 

-A few of the giants in Jotunheim have their heads bashed in. There's dried blood on the mountains they're leaning against.

-I highly doubt Freya will be a villain in the next game. I can't imagine Odin will give her back her wings. If anything that could backfire on him when she figures out that Odin is the mind behind all of the mess she's been through. 

-When you go to the Jotunheim realm tower in the realm between realms, there's no archaic runes etched on the braziers. Once the tower reappears, there's runes. No idea why the switch occurs though.

-When you max out the axe, you get an achievement that says ""Worthy"". We know the team leaves Marvel references all over the game. The Infinity Gauntlet is somewhat in the game (the game's take on it at least). So is this the biggest hint that we'll be able to pick up Mjolnir in the next game?",280,public,
GodofWar,t3_c4hfwj,chest bug (minor spoiler to some people but not really),"I've read a bunch of forums on this, including here on reddit, and I've done a lot of googling, but I haven't found a conclusive answer to this.

My runs consist of two loops. One to defeat enemies, unlock nornir chests, and open wooden chests and coffins, and one to open legendary and nornir chests. My second run always has exactly one legendary chest already open. By this I mean I didn't open it on my first run. It was closed the last time I saw it after defeating the surrounding enemies and continuing the loop, but when I come back to it on the second loop, it's already open. Every time, without fail, there's always an open chest on my second loop, always in the ""first base"" section of the map.

What causes this? I've tried refreshing the area, saving and quitting, closing and restarting the application. So what gives? Anyone know anything about this? I know it's just one chest, but it's bugging me.

In the backyard there is a ladder covered with black tree roots which you can normally burn with the chaos blades.

GodofWar,t3_c4b45k,Question About Armor Levels,"Apologies if this has been asked before, but google turned up nothing, so here goes!

I am in the endgame now, completed muspelheim part one and working my way through niflheim, and when I looked at the armors I can craft from each place, I realized the muspel armor was level 4, with much worse stats than the level 7 niflheim armor. 

I assume this is because I actually visited muspelheim much earlier in the game, so the armor i scaled to how powerful I was. It's still legendary armor that is very expensive to get and has cool effects, but the stats are basically useless compared to the armor I have available now. 

Is there any way to fix this? I haven't tried upgrading it, but it seems to me upgrading always only increases the stats of armor by twos or fours.

GodofWar,t3_c1zr6s,Not having internet at my new house made me fully appreciate how amazing God of War is.,"I've always been a fan of the series. Played the 3 main games, one of the PSP games (where the main antagonist is Persephone), subscribed to PS Now just to play Ascension, and got the new one the day it came out. However, on my first playthrough,  I didn't get all the extras, such as Odin's ravens,  didn't beat the Valkyrie Queen, etc. I mainly played the main story due to my friends hounding me to get back to playing Blackout with them. Now that I don't have internet at my new house, I sat down and played God of War again. And this time around, I'm 5 ravens away from platinum. I finally beat the Valkyrie queen, and I overall enjoyed gaming so much more now that I'm offline. I was thinking about getting internet hooked up, but nah, online kinda ruins the fun in gaming for me. I enjoy single player story games so much more. Once I beat the game again, I'm super psyched to play it in NG+ from what I read about it. Next, I'll play Horizon Zero Dawn again and then do the Frozen Wilds DLC that I bought and downloaded before I moved. Then, its NG+ for that game as well.

GodofWar,t3_c22ss8,More theories about Atreus: he's a time traveler,"I'll **try** to be brief. Mimir said that Ragnarok ""already happened in the future"", and Jormungandr came back to the past as a result of his fight with Thor, and coming from the future explains why he recognized Atreus. If we follow Norse mythology, we should know that the World Serpent is Loki's son, and maybe that's why Jormungandr felt that Atreus looked so familiar. So, if Loki is Jormungandr's father in the game (cuz that could be modified as GoW games tend to change some things to make a better story), that would mean, of course, that for Ragnarok to happen Atreus should be able to reproduce, then have children, so Thor can finally fight Jormungandr. 

Another interesting fact is that, after Norse mythology, Hela is Loki's daughter too, and she already reigns Helheim in GoW 4. So, we have two possibilities: GoW games will modify some facts about Loki's children so that Hela, Jormungandr (and maybe Fenrir later)  appearances make sense, OR JORMUNGANDR IS NOT THE ONLY TIME TRAVELER AFTER RAGNAROK, LOKI ALSO CAME BACK TO THE PAST, to get his revenge, and that's why all the Norse gods hate Loki so much, he's portrayed as the God of Mischief because he's always causing trouble to the gods, as he hates them. The reason of why Atreus and Kratos don't know about Loki (who is actually ""Future Atreus"" that came back to the past) is because he's always changing his form, transforming into something else, and some gods even don't know what Loki's real form is. Jormungandr does, cuz Loki is his father.

What equipment, talismans, and rune skills do I need to get to level 8 or 9?  

Also, I keep dying against Sigrun and at most can get her to half health. Can't, or honestly don't really know what to do while waiting for my skills to recharge (cooldown stat is pretty high but none of my armor is fully upgraded yet) and I struggle to dodge and figure out what moves to block. My strategy for all the other Valkyries was just spamming skills and taking advantage of full rage after reviving from death, but that isn't working for this fight due to her durability. Afraid to level up though because I heard she gets scaled up based on your level.

I'm currently on normal difficulty and the last guide I read recommended switching to give me a story difficulty....but not sure if I want to do that yet, or if it will make a difference.

Any advice on builds and skills for this fight?

Both Logan and Kratos have mellowed out to an extent in their old age and are even protecting young children. Following along? Good. So now that we established that, let‚Äôs get into it. In the movie, X-24 is a young clone of Logan. Way more aggressive and constant rage. His own worst enemy is himself and in both instances X-24 destroys him. Only to be saved by Laura (X-23) with an adamantium bullet. As I  said in a post a few weeks ago that blew up on here, Thor is a mirror of Kratos. He is who Kratos would‚Äôve been had he stayed loyal to the Olympians and was still full rage mode. Thor I think will very much over power Kratos due to his constant rage and try to even kidnap Atreus for revenge against him for killing his sons. X-24 also tried to kidnap Laura during the movie. I think we will fight Thor and in both instances or at least when we kill him, Atreus will be the one to save Kratos somehow or at least even the odds. He broke Baldurs curse in GOW4 and maybe he‚Äôll remove Thor‚Äôs belt that doubles his strength in 5 (if we‚Äôre going by mythology and assume he has his belt in it).

With this in mind is it worth farming a bunch of xp in the early game. My friends told me about a glitch to do with the parry achievement then resetting to the last checkpoint to get loads of xp over and over.

GodofWar,t3_c0rc1v,New player.. questionable gameplay,"Hey,

So, I'm in fairly early, but I just wanna raise a few grievances with some of the gameplay as I feel it's just partly badly designed but feel free to teach me some top tips.

Revenants feel extremely bad to fight. Lots of teleporting, which isn't too bad, but then they are just brown blobs, in brown environments which makes them really hard to telegraph react. Added on to that their animations are really poor. Thier attacks look very similar to their stagger animations that it's hard to tell when they're taking damage or when they are swinging at you making them pretty unfair and unfun to fight. Throw in that you also tend to play Vs two of them and they run away to corner so you will always have your back to one throwing homing missiles at you it feels particular unfair.

Ancients, so these guys are visually cool and rewarding to fight. But man some of their attacks feel VERY unfair. 
The explosion missiles are by far their best designed attack, gives you time to attack if you dodge with good timing, but also pose a very serious threat.
However the laser that goes to your feet is pretty damn stupid. It's very fast, instantly does damage, and tracks you perfectly. This attack is very very badly designed imo. Especially because this is supposed to be the one time you hit them back, but you can't because you need to dodge a very fast tracking high damaging ability.
Combine this with the fact that it has the exact same starting animation as the missiles you either lose damage on the missiles expecting a laser do are running around, or you expect missiles and take damage from the laser. 
You can easily fix this by adding a charging animation to the laser so you can prepare for a moment.

Finally another weakness of the game is it's camera. It feels like a really narrow view, so you can very often get hit from behind, throw in a projectile, a speedy fireboi enemy, and you take damage before you can really react. Feels kinda unfair.

Please let me know if I'm wrong though! And I do love the combat it's just these few niggles that are really pressing me.",0,public,

I noticed something strange in Tyr's temple (in the room where you get the black rune). If you climb the wall and jump down you land close to a pillar that has an arrow pointing upwards. Higher up there's one pointing down, and then up again.

Now the weird thing: if I stand in front of that pillar and press down two times to turn around quickly, I hear a strange noise. I hear the same noise if I stand facing away from the pillar and then move my character or just look back around without using the down key (see included video) .

It reminds me of the gong you hear when getting the secret 'forbidden grip of the ages'. It also made a noise when you made a mistake I think.

So is there a secret here that I'm missing? Is there a sequence you have to follow that I can't find out? Has anyone else noticed this and maybe gotten any further?

GodofWar,t3_c00r0d,The one scene that bothers me in GoW 4 (SPOILERS),"When Kratos comes face-to-face with Baldur, for the second time, Baldur impales Kratos with a piece of stone. This gives Kratos immense amount of pain and you can see Kratos holding the area where he was impaled. Even when Atreus pushes Kratos away, Kratos goes back to holding the punctured area because it hurts. However, there is no hole or blood and moments later, he acts as if nothing happened and he goes to fight Baldur. This was an in-cutscene wound that Kratos received so shouldn't it have been more prominent? In previous installments, Kratos has been hurt and the gameplay acknowledges this. For example, in Ghost of Sparta, Deimos punches Kratos into a bloody mess. Kratos doesn't pick himself up right away to sprint and fight Thanatos. He struggles to get his posture and slowly walks away from his blood pool.

I'm not saying Kratos should have been out for the count, due to his wound, I'm saying there should have been a little more time to acknowledge it. The impaling served little purpose since Kratos basically shrugged it off. Kratos is durable, however, he's not invincible. He was even killed by Ares, in a similar fashion, by being impaled by stone (a much bigger piece, mind you). This particular scene just stood out to me.",295,public,

GodofWar,t3_bzm46b,Kratos' idiolect,"I haven't seen this confirmed by Santa Monica and haven't seen it discussed, but I got the sense that the way Kratos speaks in the Norse game isn't just him being a gruff man, it's reflective of his lack of familiarity with the old Norse language. From ""Boy!"" and ""Woman!"" and ""Head!"" to ""do not speak again"" and ""it was her wish, and it was time"" and ""the Axe did not return"" and ""you would not listen"" and ""LEAVE MY HOME"", Kratos not only is a man of fewer words than he was in the previous games but he uses certain words in an odd way and in sentences his words are generally very emphatic and weighty. Every other character displays a much more casual and flowy idiolect, and there are even anachronisms like Atreus saying ""duh"" 

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but my parents had to learn English and I noticed some similarities in their and Kratos' usage of it. If I'm right, it's just another display of the attention to detail and care that went into this game 

Btw if it wasn't obvious, you can surmise that the whole game they're conversing in Old Norse from their ability to communicate with other characters  and then it's brought to attention when Atreus tries to teach Kratos how to read Old Norse because he only knows how to speak it",495,public,
GodofWar,t3_bztjg6,Theory about the mural and Kratos‚Äô fate,"So by now we know kratos has already died before and got back from Greek mythology‚Äôs hell without that much trouble. If the mural‚Äôs painting is correct kratos dies, but what happens to those who die in Nordic mythology you may ask. Well if they died a warriors dead like kratos most likely would, a Valkyrie takes them to Valhalla, and we know at least one important Valkyrie. So get this, kratos could die fighting Thor and maybe freya takes him to Valhalla so she can get her revenge, or perhaps he dies fighting freya and afterwards she takes him there maybe regretting killing him, or maybe she was already going there idk. Anyways kratos now is in Valhalla and can get to Odin.



Also, Valhalla‚Äôs description is that it‚Äôs heaven and the warriors are happy to be there fighting 24/7 basically. I imagine Santa Monica can spin this idea pretty well and show that it‚Äôs actually torturous to be there and only Odin really likes it or something",16,public,Spoilers

GodofWar,t3_bzjnej,God of War backstory questions!,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YETCT15X4gE

I have the following questions about the above video, in my desperate search to learn more about the God of War franchise...

I‚Äôve put a time marker for the video linked by each question as it relates to the specific part of the video.

5:00 - how did Kratos get God-like powers to begin with if he was just a man that made an oath to Ares?

5:00 - how can queen of underworld reunite Kratos with his fallen daughter? Is this god reviving the daughter?

5:30 - how can Kratos go up against Atlas and the queen of underworld if he gave his god-like powers up to see his daughter?

5:48 - why does Atlas hold the world on his shoulders? I know he‚Äôs chained in there but can‚Äôt he still drop it as he and queen of underworld originally planned?

5:53 - why does Kratos commit himself to losing his memory again? Did the option of seeing his daughter (revived or otherwise) get taken away from him when the queen of underworld died?

9:30 - ‚Äúthe gods will pay for this‚Äù is Kratos referring to the god of death killing his brother? Or just the general shit they‚Äôve been throwing his way?

10:50 - why was Kratos rescued by Gia and why did he help Kratos her revenge?

11:00 - again, how can Kratos have so much power if he put it all in the blade of Olympus before Zeus killed him? Is he just less powerful but still powerful enough as a mortal to defeat this foes on the island of creation?

11:45 - why do the titans wish to help defeat Olympus and the gods? I‚Äôm guessing Kratos could not beat Zeus after accidentally killing Athena, which is why he has to gather an army of titans?

12:30 - why does pandora want to sacrifice herself to extinguish the flame of Olympus?

GodofWar,t3_bzi2t2,Could Loki Be The Sequel's Villain?,"So, we all know that Atreus grows up to become Loki and something time travel happens, he gets sent to the past, the World Serpent gets sent to the past and Fenrir is born. For some reason, Odin releases Fenrir's sons and they bring Kratos to Midgard. Now, I'm not the most educated on Norse mythology aside from the book Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman, which was a while ago, so I'll be honest, I'm very likely wrong about some of this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

But, essentially, after the murder of Baldur by Hodr, Loki humiliates the Aesir to such a degree at a dinner that even Odin cannot stop him. Thor comes in and Loki gets scared and shuts the fuck up. Loki is soon thereafter taken by the Aesir to a cave deep within the Earth with his wife Sigyn and their two sons. One son is transformed into a werewolf and made to kill the other son, whose guts are then used to chain a despondent Loki. A snake is positioned to drip venom into Loki's eyes for all eternity, with Sigyn collecting the venom in a bowl and dumping it when it gets full. When she dumps it, the snake drips so hard that Loki goes woo on a bitch and tries to escape his bonds, his strength triggering earthquakes. Eventually, Loki breaks free with such force that Ragnarok begins. He goes to Hel and has his daughter Hela lead the legions of the dead out against the Aesir, his son Fenrir is freed and the end of the Gods begins.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what if the villain in the second game isn't Thor, isn't Odin, but it's Loki? We know that Ragnarok is coming and Odin knows how he dies. So what if he let Fenrir's sons drag Kratos to Midgard to change the timeline, bring him there in a different manner than he would have come and ultimately change the order of things. Ragnarok happens sooner, Loki breaks free and Kratos takes Heimdall's place against him. What if that's the crux of Odin's trickery: have Kratos kill his own son to present him with a choice:

&amp;#x200B;

1. To ensure that Odin is killed, allow Atreus to live his life as it would has gone down in the timeline. Let him go back in time, become blood brother to the Gods by exchanging blood with Odin, father the beasts and eventually destroy the world as we know it only to get killed by his own father in the end.
2. Change Atreus' fate at the cost of Odin no longer being bound by Ragnarok and surviving to continue his hustle, his grand trickery in pursuit of knowledge, once more, this time Jinder unhindered.

GodofWar,t3_bz7rlm,"Hey guys, I need your help. I just started GMGOW, and it's kicking my teeth in","This is going to be a very lengthy post, it's my first time posting here and I want you all to understand where I'm coming from when I share certain opinions below.

So a few days ago, I finally beat my first playthrough of Sekiro. It was an amazing game, with an absolutely stellar finish with the final boss being one of the hardest and best designed bosses in gaming (imo). When I finally beat it after probably 50 tries, I was drunk on the challenge it presented and decided I should pick up my absolute favorite game of the last few years, and beat it on the hardest difficulty, God of War.

Now, I knew this was going to be a challenge. I've seen all your posts about how the first set of draugr kicked your asses and made you quickly adapt to how GMGOW needed to be played, which is to say, relentlessly. And I did exactly that, and it was STILL a challenge, but I loved it, and was ready for more

At least that's what I thought

As I continued through the gruelling combat and became a god (get it?) at switching strategies to suit the situation and making sure I kept the enemy where I wanted them and keeping them from buffing, I started to figure it out. And it felt really good.

And then Atreus broke that dumb wooden bridge, and suddenly I felt like I was playing a different game. I understand that GMGOW is supposed to be INSANELY difficult, that's what I wanted after all, but this fight just seemed unfair. Enemies everywhere that can quickly surround you in an area that feels way too small for the number there are, and two fire throwing draugr above you that take 4 or 5 hits with the thrown axe to take down, AND a fight with three heavies and more standard draugr, I just had this sinking feeling. I died at least several dozen times before I finally got it, and when I did, I didn't feel like I had won the battle because I got better or overcame the challenge, I felt like I had just gotten lucky. But you know what hey, I beat it, so its time to move on to the next battle.

And now, I'm stuck again, in that little area right after the second Apple, where the fight starts with a Revenant and two heavy draugr. And guys, I just can't do it.

I have gotten my parry times down perfectly (Sekiro helped a lot with that), I am always ready to dodge attacks from the side or behind, and I am relentless in my attacks, doing the best I can to never let my enemies catch a breath. And yet, I die anyway, because as more enemies join the fray, it just seems impossible to manage all of it.

I've heard from friends and from other posts that it gets easier once you can upgrade your equipment and have more skills, since they give you more tools to deal with the onslaught, and you can customize Kratos to fit your playstyle. But for right now, I just don't see how I'm going to get past it, and it has caused me to have something I never expected to have in this game: a complaint.

Now, before I go on, I want to make it clear that I absolutely ADORE this game. Its right up there with the greatest games of all time, and I will always remember it fondly. But here's my issue, and to illustrate it, I'm going to go back to Sekiro since its so fresh in my mind (keeping it spoiler free of course).

The final boss of Sekiro is an absolute masterpiece, and it's because of its brilliant design. It is so unbelievably difficult, but at no point do you feel it's unfair. Every time I died, it was because I screwed up, I made a mistake, and I got punished for it. It was firm, but fair, so to speak.

This fight in GMGOW doesn't feel that way. You are at such a disadvantage in almost every way, with enemies being able to buff themselves in almost no time at all, not being able to stagger most enemies before they even buff at all, and just the sheer number of them, it just doesn't seem reasonable, and to me it just isn't that much fun. In fact, if I'm being a hundred percent honest, those design choices seem kind of lazy, just a cop out way to make the combat incredibly difficult without actually putting in that much extra effort.

Now, I know a lot of you are probably going for that downvote button right now, and I get it. Especially since a lot of you HAVE overcome this challenge and might see it differently, but as of right now, I just don't understand it. Which, of course, is why I'm here.
 
I've been lurking on this page for a long time now, and I can honestly say it's one of the best communities on Reddit. You guys are so kind and supportive, and obviously love this game as much if not more than I do, and I need your help. Do you guys have any tips to help me get through this? Is there maybe something I'm missing here that is making this more difficult than it should? Or is this just another case of a scrub who needs to ""git gud""?

And more importantly, I want to know if any of you feel the same way as I do about the difficulty at the beginning of this game. I feel like we all love this game so much that at times we will look at it with rose tinted glasses and ignore certain flaws that it has, but EVERY game has flaws, no video game is perfect, at least in my opinion. Is there anyone else who just felt like this opening section was unfair and frustrating for the player? Do any of you feel like this could've been done in a better way, like say keeping it easier until you can upgrade Kratos, THEN ramping up the difficulty? If you've made it this far into the post, I'm sure you'll have opinions of your own you want to share, and I would love to get a discussion with y'all going.

The similarity is how he kills the bridge keeper of helheim, theres a struggle, then he breaks the pillar with the blades before shanking him through the face.

Now this next one is pure assumption, in GoW 2 we are introduced to the fates. They are  also referenced in the beginning of GoW 2018, the norns, anyone think we will see them in the sequel?

Another question I have, is how Kratos might tie into Egyptian Mythology, racked my brain for a bit and couldn't even come close to coming up with ideas... unless this could be a thanos style, big bad type thing, who ends up being an Egyptian God to end the franchise? Make sense?

Title. For example if I have two ""moderate chance of activating effect x"" thus this stack on each other giving  me a ""high chance of activating effect x?""

More examples:

2x very low chance  = low chance

2x high chance = very high chance

GodofWar,t3_bzd7ss,God of War Overrated?,"I didnt comment anything on GoW all this time that i didnt play it but i kept reading that its awesome, the best game of the year and a masterpiece and that it deserves over 10 rating etc. I played RDR2 first and AC Odyssey and now I'm playing GoW and i want to comment on this.

No, this game isnt that good. I dont understand why its so overrated and people say its a masterpiece. Imo both RDR2 and AC Odyssey are better games. Also I even prefer GoW 3 over this. Dont get me wrong, its a decent game and pleasurable to play. And the fact that its  kratos makes it even  cooler for us that we loved the old GoW games but it doesnt deserve GOTY over the other 2 games i mentioned.

Its strongest point is the graphics, its gorgeous, absolutely stunning and also because of the camera placement it gives you a cinematic feeling throughout the whole game but :

1. It has an average story
2. The camera might add to the looks but it retracks from the gameplay, you need to ""fight"" it during combat because you can see only infront of you.
3. The combat is a Dark souls and Hack &amp; slash mix type of combat which is decent but  as a DS veteran i would say its worse than DS/AC origins -odyssey. Plus you are fighting the camera too and its ""cheaper"" you just stunlock the easy enemies to death or if the big ones swarm you its a pain in the ass.
4. Unbalanced enemies and more unbalanced enemy encounters because of backtracking. Backtracking is horrible in every game. No gamer ever liked it and dont act like you enjoy it now because you're playing GoW. Also how  does it make sense that Kratos dies in 3 hits from a draugr while he needs to hit it 15 times to kill it? It makes Kratos seem weak as fuck. Also you meet simple lame enemies so strong that they will kill you in 1 hit, that shouldnt have been possible, its ridiculous. I fought &gt;!Baldur!&lt; and it seems he was 1000 times weaker than a draugr.
5. Horrible movement restriction. Yes it has it, its an open world game filled with invisible walls. You can only go where the game wants you to go. There are spots in the game with items for example that I as a normal human being would be able to  reach easily but no, Kratos cant go jump from his boat to that shore, he has to take the looong way around because  there simply isnt a ""dock"" there. Or he cant climb to that rock its  too ""tall"" for a dwarf. They totally failed in the idea of an open world because of this.
6. Lack of weapon variety
7. Lack of miniboss variety
8. Repetitive puzzles

I'm not just bashing the game like its crap, its a good game. I've played tons and tons of games over the years and this is one of the better ones but its so overrated and it got GOTY while it didnt deserve it in my opinion so i wanted to say the flaws I saw while playing. And i havent finished it yet, I just hope i wont find more negatives along the way.

My rating of the game so far would be an 8/10 and thats probably because im a Kratos fan, if it was just a different game i dont know about, it could have been 7.  And the GOTY choice between AC odyssey and RDR2 is hard.",0,public,
GodofWar,t3_bytjv4,Can Kratos die from gunshot wounds?,"Some people say that kratos can be easily penetrated or stabbed. But if i rmb correctly, he‚Äôs only been stabbed by gods with immense strength, a normal human might not be strong enough to stab through his skin. So are bullets powerful enough to penetrate him?

GodofWar,t3_byskip,Why the Aesir Gods might be harder for Kratos than the Olympians....,"As we know, the Olympians were dicks. Manipulating and ruling over mortals. Zeus was always looking to bed mortals and just straight up control them. They manipulated Kratos to do their bidding but never sought his death until he opened Pandora‚Äôs Box and started destroying towns. Athena was always helpful even though she secretly used Kratos for power. Zeus was powerful as king but he never was very bloodthirsty. He was only trying to protect Olympus but he did turn on Kratos which is a no no. Ares was a big challenge, loving war and was very violent. He‚Äôs probably the closest to an Aesir God. All Aesir Gods are part War Gods. They all have a love of fighting. The Olympians do not, they all love to well... ‚Äúlove‚Äù. Zeus just wanted to rule over mortals and be in power. That‚Äôs it.  Odin wants all knowledge of everything and he will kill anyone who gets in his way. Thor is the biggest butchering bastard in the nine realms and sounds like he might be like how Kratos used to be (I did a post on that recently). Even Valhalla is designed for warriors who die to fight and drink and bang until Ragnarok, that is their heaven. In Greece we had the Elysian Fields, a peaceful place to just enjoy life.  Different cultures will come into play here. Kratos is no longer 100% monster mode, and I think he will need to bring it back to fight a whole Pantheon, the Aesir, where every one of them is essentially a war god.",7,public,

GodofWar,t3_bypw8g,[Spoiler] how did kratos get here?,"So. Obviously in the end of kratos' greek mythology phase he put an end to his life by using the blade that could slay TITANS with ease. That should have been it. He blade of Olympus is supposed to be the end of life. Used to ""kill"" mortal kratos. Helped kill his father. Helped slay legions of the undead. But for some reason it didnt kill kratos. After all the gods lay dead. Including himself. Somehow kratos recovered from the massive self inflicted god sword wound. Patch himself up. Somehow dip into norse mythology and start a family without anyone questioning ""hey whats up with that massive scar that nearly goes all the way across your body?"" So my question is. HOW. How could kratos recover from the blade if Olympus and make a strong and fast enough recovery to begin a family probably shorty after. He massacred the greeks.

I really liked the sequence where the stranger guy punches Kratos and he goes flying and we see the camera follow him. This game transitions from cut scene to gameplay in such a seamless manner and I have never seen any other major AAA game do that. I am also digging the combat system.

1. Why do people keep saying Kratos has been made a god? ‚ÄúGod of war‚Äù is only a title, and kratos is still born a demigod?
2. If kratos has indeed been made a god, what powers did his godhood add to him?

GodofWar,t3_bynm1f,Possible subjects of interest for a possible sequel.,"A few things I wanted to share as I have studied Norse mythology more. Thought these could be a good conversation starter as we hope and look forward to a sequel!

1. In the prose Edda written by Snorri Sturluson, the Aesir gods came from the city of Troy.
2. There is evidence that supports in early Norse myth, Tyr was in fact the head of the Norse pantheon. Not Odin.
3. From an archetypal stand point, giants were not all large, oversized humanoids. They were people who were outside the ‚Äútribe‚Äù, people who were different. (I believe Mimir made some sort of comment about this soon after Kratos takes his head).
4. This may or may not mean anything, but I find interesting. Ginnungagap, which is a gaping void (could be seen as chaos) brought about the creation of the Norse cosmos/universe by the fire and ice from Niflheim and Muspelheim merging. Chaos from an archetypal stand point is seen as raw potential for either creation or destruction. I think it is kind of funny that Kratos‚Äô main weapons are both Fire and Ice.",3,public,Spoilers
GodofWar,t3_byk8mf,I‚Äôve restarted the game in Hard mode,"After beating the Valkyrie Queen and everything in normal, I felt pretty good about myself and I‚Äôve tried out hard now.

I don‚Äôt usually play games in hard but I just really liked God of War and I didn‚Äôt want to just do the same play through.

What I‚Äôm getting at is that I‚Äôm not so into getting a challenge from a game and I‚Äôm doing this mostly to explore this world again but from a sightly different perspective. But then I saw a nightmare fuse with a level 1 druag and the fusion proceeded to One shot me. 

This legitimately freaked me out the first time I saw it and I I guess I‚Äôve gotten what I wanted, that‚Äôs certainly something I didn‚Äôt ever see in my Normal play through.

I know half the fun of the game is discovering your own play style but I get very easily discouraged from grinding that goes nowhere and I only got through the Valkyrie Queen because she was literally the last thing in the game.

GodofWar,t3_byea0f,"Call me crazy but I expect the next game around mid 2020, heres why","So heres my reasoning:

First of all, I know most people expect it to be for the PS5, and it makes sense, but I think that due to the nature of the game and how it was built, that they can pull it off much earlier, and make it the last PS4 exclusive. They could always milk a ""remastered"" version on the ps5 anyway

-On the Raising Keatos documentary, right after the E3 reveal section, they talk about how they were scared that it took them too long to proddice the trailer, the guy says ""it took us 2 years to produce those 10 minutes, and we have like a year and half to do 30 hours of game, and we dont know if thats humanely possible. You can also see by the end that they had to turn the game in by January 2018. So it took them less than 2 years to go from the trailer to the final product.

-Technically speaking, their engine is already optimized for stuff like the one-shot camera, realm traveling, fast travel, how Atreus works, how the Axe works, etc.

-And assets like the lake of nine and Tyr's temple, will most definetly make a return, so other than some visual updates (and maybe some paths blocked by snow or something), I doubt they need to spend a lot of time on it.

-While we obviously should expect new enemies, the basic ones like draugrs and hel walkers, wolves, wolverns, etc, will make a return, so theres not much to polish there.

-Sunny Suljic is at that point where he is growing up by the day, if they want him to fit the timeline, they should be doing his stuff by now.

-Most importantly, we know that the game had a very limited budget and lots of doubts from SM's bosses. That wont be the case here, after the success of the first one, Im certain that SM will get a much bigger budget and a lot of support from Sony, and I dont see them wanting to delay it till the Ps5 is out.

-All this Ragnarok is Coming teasing from twitter and the ps4 theme, would be kinda weird if the game was still 2-3 years away.


So, I dont find it impossible for it to be out mid 2020, which would be about 2 and a half years after they finished the first one, which they made in less than 2 years once they had the engine optimized for the reveal.",14,public,

The combat is so fast and you can really only get hit once. The margin for error is very slim. Its very rewarding however because it forces you to literally use every single tool you have unlocked to that point ON TOP of thinking critically on how to dispatch each mob. While I enjoy this challenge I'm no sure how far I will go in the end. Perhaps after unlocking armor, more skills, and runic attacks will make mob kills easier. Right now even fighting three enemies is hard.

GodofWar,t3_bw08et,My theory for God of War 5,"I have a theory that the next game will start with a fight with Thor where Thor places his hammer on Kratos while he kills Loki as he causes Ragnarok. 

Kratos will then travel to Hel pulling Loki out of Hel where he can meet Hela and he is warned that people don‚Äôt come back the same Kratos ignores her and takes Loki back. On there way back they get attacked by Freya and fight across 8 realms but not Asgard and they end their fight in the realm of the Valkyries where Kratos rips of her Freya‚Äôs wings but keeps her alive.

 Atreus and Kratos then have to escape back to Midgard and as they get back to the lake of the nine heimdal appears and try‚Äôs to kill Atreus/ Loki and he dies but Loki‚Äôs eyes are injured in the fight. Before his death heimdal blows his horns with his last breath signaling he start of Ragnarok. Kratos hunts down Freya and makes her help him save Loki‚Äôs eyes and give him back his vision she sees the love in which Kratos shows for Atreus and she helps. However the more magic used on Atreus corrupts him more and he wishes to take vengeance on the Aesir Kratos tries to stop him and they have a small fight but Atreus escapes. Kratos with the help of Freya hunts down Atreus, while Atreus returns to Hel and asks Hela to bring an army of the dead to attack Asgard, Hela accepts. Kratos and Freya catch up to Atreus in Midgard where Kratos warns him not to go through with this but when Atreus ignores  Kratos pled Kratos decides to stand with his son. 

They travel to the realm of the dwarfs to get an item they lets them travel to Asgard and when they returns they come across Odin Thor and an army at the bridge of Tyr. Freya then betrays them and is given new wings and a big fight ensues in which the world serpent dies. But Kratos destroys Thor‚Äôs hammer using the axe but the axe is destroyed in the process. Atreus kills Freya for betraying them.

 Odin flees to Asgard where Kratos and Atreus team up to fight Odin and Atreus kills Odin similar to the way Kratos kills Zeus. This opens Kratos‚Äô eyes to what he has become and Atreus and Kratos fight one last time. Soon the world serpent in thrown up out of Atreus‚Äô mouth and he grows big quickly and Thor returns where he fights the world serpent knocking him back in time and Thor delivers a fatal blow to kratos and Atreus kills Thor. Atreus cradles kratos similar to the painting at the end of this game and Atreus leaves travelling to a new world. Hopefully Egypt.  
 

Sorry if this is long haha 
EDIT: I know this has turned out more like a fan fiction now but I still like it 
Edit 2: I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll fit it in but I‚Äôd love to see Atreus call the leviathan axe to himself at a point maybe in the first fight with Thor",0,public,Spoilers

GodofWar,t3_bvkh5x,Is Cory Barlog gonna direct GoW 5 too?,"I feel like this man's enthusiasm  and dedication was one of, if not, the biggest reasons made the game as succesful as it is. After watching Raising Kratos i felt like he is truly the heart of God of War. One thing that impressed me was how he called out that one guy who tried to ""trick"" him because the pause menu wasn't really done and he tried to convince Cory that skipping animation was already there, even tho he didn't show him when Cory insisted. I felt like he kept pushing people just like that during the whole project so they didn't half-ass anything and approached the whole thing with great care.

I checked his twitter after watching the doc like i just said, and in a part of his twitter bio it says ""Tired. Finally done with the game."" so it left me a little worried about the future of the franchise. GoW 3 was fantastic and a great end to the first era of the story but at that time i remember i felt like it was a little step down from GoW 2 and didn't know the reason until last year when i saw Cory Barlog interviews. Maybe i am exaggerating but that is what i feel like, and i wanted to share it with you guys in this sub because if anywhere on the internet i can find people who also love God of War, it is probably here.

I was as usual doing a farming re-run on Plus +, and I was at the point where Freya brought back Thamur during the Baldur fight, when it stroke me: 

Kratos is the most nerfed ""God"" as crazy this might sound.  

What I mean by that:  
Kratos has no special God like powers other his supernatural strength which ties him at a Heracles level.   

He is not omnipotent, omnipresent, can't travel in time on demand, can't create life, bring back to life others, he doesn't have any magic or can practice spells, does not have gear-free abilities like Zeus, Hera, Athena, Hades, Odin, Freya, etc.

Every map, goal, mission, quest, side or main, Easter Egg, top gear, statistical/numerical feat, and achievement for God of War is completed :D

I think a great moment of development could be if he visits Greece and sees it in a prosperous state now that mankind no longer has to live under the rule of that pantheon.

You'd think this would be hard to watch as he really goes for it, but because Baldur is such an annoyance you're sitting there rooting for Kratos as he beats the ever-living shit out of his enemies. 

This nicely mirrors Kratos' own rage and justification of such violence; it's only after the heat of the moment that you as the player sit back and go ""Damn, maybe that was harsh of me after all"". 

It's all sort of like what Egoraptor talks about in his Sequelitis on The Legend of Zelda. You want to obtain the Master Sword because it's literally more powerful at doing what you're playing the game to do (defeat evil) but also because the character needs to obtain it.

From what I understand ascension spoils the first game, I am not sure if it spoils the others but I‚Äôve already watched a recap video so I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter too much. Its just the first game in the timeline .

GodofWar,t3_btlvix,Thor is a mirror of Kratos...,"I‚Äôm convinced Thor is going to be young Kratos. Kills everything in his path for no reason, even innocence.  Like that spirit who wanted us to destroy the statue, he said Thor showed up and killed his mom at the funeral of his dad. Kratos killed many innocence back in the day. Like the slave girl in GOW3 who got killed by  the door crank collapsing. Or even random people you can kill in GOW 1 and 2. Really puts it in perspective that Kratos was a monster just like Thor. Kratos was a slave and the champion of Olympus. Thor is willingly, the champion of Asgard. However, the Olympians feared Kratos because of his destruction to innocent towns as god of war, Zeus then killed him thinking that he would try to kill him, a threat. Kratos wanted nothing to do with ruling Olympus. Odin and Thor however are different. Thor murders giants and everyone else  at the behest of Odin. No fear of power struggle. Had Kratos continued to serve the Olympians until his old age like in this game, thats the kind of Thor were gonna see. A character who‚Äôs pure rage and does whatever the Aesir ask of him for their glory. Thor is a mirror of who Kratos used to be and I think that will be the scarier part for Kratos.

I would also like to take the time to add that everything we get with the dwarves is not necessarily ""good"".

A mad dwarven king sends his people to the brink of ruin for a quest. Well, they are ruined.

Fafnir is a thief, and is turned into a dragon.

Ivaldi created a deadly mist that would, in turn, end up killing him.

GodofWar,t3_btnngi,Have fun and don't obsess over fully upgrading all your gear before NG+!,"Hey, I love this game! I love it's story, it's combat, worldbuilding, lore, everything! I have played through it three times now, including GMGOW on NG+ so i consider myself a bit of a veteran at this point and I keep seeing a lot of people with questions regardig endgame gear and how to get all armor sets fully upgraded before starting the first NG+.

&amp;#x200B;

My advise: don't bother. It may seem like a sensible thing to do but in NG+, in no time, you will have about 4 or 5 completely new armorsets, heaps of axe handles, blades pommels and talismans that outperform the epic or legendary versions at base level. This makes the effort put into all that NG gear feel completely useless. So i advise you to just get one armorset, a few handles and pommels you like, upgrade that to about max level so you have some good starting gear, upgrade the axe and blades to max level (they won't upgrade further in NG+) and open all nornir chests for the health an spartan rage meter (this also doesn't level any further in NG+) before starting NG+ but not more. Any of the nornir chests, runic attacks and summons, axe and blades upgrades you missed in NG, you can allways get later in NG+, though it makes it easier to gather those at the end of the first playthrogh, if you are starting an NG+ on a higher difficulty. Upgrading runic attacks is done with XP so this basically happens on it's own and can continue through into NG+, no problem.

The first playthrough should just be a fun experience, not a perfectionist slog, save that for later, in NG+, that's my advise.

GodofWar,t3_btfm09,A Quick Guide to Muspelheim Hard Trial 1: Kill Enemies in Quick Succession,"I've seen a few people mention that they've had trouble with this trial, and I remember being frustrated with it when I first tried it, so here are some tips to help you get through it if you're struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, if you have the wrong setup you're going to have a bad time. You need to equip runic attacks that have large areas of effect and/or very high damage, and ideally you want armour that gives you high stats in attack and runic (and perhaps cooldown).

&amp;#x200B;

Some recommended runics include Hel's Touch, Strike of the Utgard, Wrath of the Frost ancient, Glaive Storm, Nemean Crush, Hyperion Slam, Meteoric Slam.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first wave, kite the enemies and group them together, chip away at their health if you have low strength/runic stats. Once they're weakened and herded together, blast them with a runic (or two if needed) then mop up any survivors.

&amp;#x200B;

In the second wave, you can start by weakening the revenant to half health, but mainly you want to focus on the troll until it's stunned, then use the troll to kill the revenant. Use Atreus to keep the revenant in place and vulnerable to your steed. Put down your pet troll the moment you defeat the revenant and the animation should finish in time before the revenant respawns.

&amp;#x200B;

The third wave is the hardest because there are a lot of enemies and two of them hide underground. Similarly to the first wave, you want to kite and herd the enemies together, and chip away at the tatzelwurms' health if possible. Once they're grouped together smash them with a powerful runic or two such as Glaive Storm and/or Hyperion Slam. Mop up the survivors. If this is still difficult then use the talisman of the realms to buy yourself a few seconds to find an angle of approach.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's](https://youtu.be/w-B50e-vaoA) a video of how I did it on my current run, although I already have the full Zeus set here, so I didn't need to weaken enemies much before going for the kill.",14,public,

Killing a god and taking his weapon/head/boots is exactly what the old Kratos would do. Kratos isn‚Äôt that same person anymore. Part of me thinks it would be cool character/story wise if after we kill Thor, Kratos takes the hammer and destroys it. It would make sense for him in some ways, and it would be so satisfying that Kratos would destroy the god and weapon that wiped out his wife‚Äôs people and so many other innocent Norse folk. That way it could never harm anyone again. 

Sure it would stink not getting to use it ourselves, but it could make for a powerful plot point.",565,public,
GodofWar,t3_bs6f7t,Tyr‚Äôs temple implications on the next games,"I don‚Äôt know if this has been discussed but I was very surprised when I saw the Murals in Tyr‚Äôs temple with Icons from Japanese and Egyptian myths.

I think this means that the next games will explore the myths of the other Countries. Here‚Äôs my reasoning.

1. It seems we‚Äôre done with traversing the majority of the 9 realms and the new games must maintain the open world aspect so like Elder scrolls, we will go to different lands for new open world experiences.

2. The Story hasn‚Äôt  explained how Kratos got to Midgard to begin with and yet according to the panels in Jotenheim, Kratos arriving is a very big deal. 

3. We must do something about Ragnarok. The story seems to be going in the direction of the destruction of the 9 realms via Ragnarok but I don‚Äôt think it will happen. Odin wants to prevent this as well so you might think it‚Äôs a bad thing but I think this intentionally the opposite of the Old God of war where Kratos incites and apocalypse. In this game Kratos will end the Apocalypse.

4. I think the only way of preventing Ragnarok will be combining knowledge from all the other mythologies and lands and such. Tyr must have had a reason to travel to all these other mythologies and I think it will be that all the lands eventually combine there efforts to defeat Odin and also stop Ragnarok. 

That‚Äôs about what I think will happen. The next game will be Egypt and the last will be Japan and one of the games will probably go to back to Greece and Odin and his pantheon will be the over arching enemy chasing Kratos and Atreus through all the mythologies.",2,public,

GodofWar,t3_brvu2r,After watching Raising Kratos I have some thoughts about the narrative direction of the next few games,"At the conclusion of the documentary (which was amazing, Shannon Studstill, Yumi Yang, Cory Barlog and everyone at SSM who worked on the game seem like very passionate and driven people) Barlog talks about the nature of success and compares it to being a parent, I think what he says has narrative implications for the games to come and how they continue Atreus and Kratos' story. The direct quote is:

&gt;""...which is kind of, I guess, like a parent. You're gonna sacrifice, work really hard and then they're gonna fucking hate you in fifteen years and not talk to you for ten years and then they're gonna be like 'hey I remember why you were pretty good'""

It may be this is the narrative direction going forward, with Atreus and Kratos having a falling out and Atreus fulfilling his role as Loki in the mythology, working with the Norse pantheon in some way instead of against them for a time, and finally, given enough time, reconciling with his father.

Very excited to see what the team at SSM come up with and over a year after release still in awe at what they achieved in terms of narrative, gameplay and the world they built.

GodofWar,t3_bs91ai,Just Finished God of War (2018): The Good and Bad,"This is my first God of War game ever, and I just finished it. Here's what I loved, and what I didn't like (so much). For reference, I'm a big Souls fan + Bloodborne and Sekiro, so my opinions are from this background.

**Fantastic story + Music**

It's clear that a lot of love has gone into this game. Whoever wrote the story truly feels invested. The music drives home the emotional highlights. Kratos's journey with his son is a study in character development. I didn't expect a video game story to be this sophisticated and emotional.

Freya was magnificent as well. A complex personality, whom we love. And though we never see Kratos's wife and Atreus's mother, we can still feel her presence throughout the game.

The story is a beautiful work of art. The Baldur fights are cinematic accomplishments in their own right, and carry a lot of weight.

**Almost no Boss Fights**

The only ""real"" boss in the game is Sigrun - the Valkyrie queen. The others big enemies are just repeats of one another. This is one of the biggest departures from the Souls games.

**Combat is Frenetic: Can be Either Good or Bad Depending on Taste**

Unlike Souls games, Kratos fights multiple enemies at all times. In Souls games, fights are methodical, and carefully controlled. In GoW, there are waves and waves of enemies, luck plays a big role, and you get surrounded often. It's a matter of taste. I personally didn't like fighting multiple enemies at once, but that's the GoW signature I suppose.

**Can Induce Motion Sickness**

For someone who gets seasick easily, there's altogether too much boat riding! In the first 5 minutes of the game, I had to turn off the camera shake options. Without that, I wouldn't have been able to continue at all. But there's still a bunch of boat travel that induces motion sickness. And at one point in the game, you have to be on a huge ship that's floating around. Very bad!

**Difficulty Levels are Messed Up**

The game's difficulty at higher levels consists of more health for enemies, and more damage taken. Unlike Souls' games, where the difficulty is more organic. It's difficult to explain, but when playing ""Give me a Challenge"" with no skills unlocked, I didn't feel satisfied beating mobs. Just tired. It's a bit ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottom Line: Story Makes up for it All**

The story and the music are killer. It's what makes the game awesome in my opinion. I won't be playing it again on harder difficulties, because like I said, I don't like the way the game makes things hard. But it's been an amazing experience. Even the lack of boss fights (exception Sigrun) doesn't detract from the experience. I'm very happy I bought and played it!",0,public,

GodofWar,t3_br9iuv,My GOW review... average game. Find out why.,"Hello,

Here is my GOW review, and yes I won't be kind with it.

Overall it's a masterpiece in term of graphism and environment design, but poor in term of gameplay, and rather boring to play.

Fighting is the core of the game and it sucks. Fights are rather simple, repetitive, no room for expressing your own style : press attack button like a retard, duck, attack, go to next fight, repeat...You can never make a smart move using something unusual, natural feature, or even escape a fight!Finishing a big enemy always ends by a pre-recorded cinematic scene, which kills the intensity of fights... killing is only done indirectly.

And about 50% of the game is non-playing time:- Tons of puzzles games which have nothing interesting and after each of them you blame the developers for having you wasting 10 minutes.- Watching thousands of times the very same boring mini cut-scenes occurring every 2 minutes : climbing a wall, crawling, opening a chest, improving a weapon, taking a gate, achieving an enemy, talking to the dwarfs, etc.- Collect tons of shit that I don't care, to buy/activate improvements that I don't see the effect, through menus that are more complex than filling my annual tax report.- Try to find where you have to go and commute.

If you remove the amazing graphism, it's realy an average game.Zelda BOTW which has a similar gameplay, makes fights a million time more interresting and intense, makes you want to progress and collect new items, and gives you a lot of pleasure commuting (exploring wild places, riding a horse, gliding the parachute...)  


**EDIT A FEW DAYS LATER**  


**Thank you all for your insights and the discussion.**  
**I checked some videos of pro playing** and indeed, they are doing little things that I did not do in the game.  
But not much. GOW plays more or less the same whether you are good or not. You still walk on the same narrow pre-defined tracks with zero movement freedom, you still do the very same fights that you cannot skip and you still kill ennemies the very same way : retard push R1/R2 until it's over.   
**Overall GOW gameplay does not allow any room for freedom or growing with it.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good counter-example with the new game I just started : **Gravity Rush.**  
**From the first hour playing, I felt like a powerful super hero (DC/Marvel) doing incredible things ! Something I never felt with GOW.**

GodofWar,t3_bqmztv,It's the Ending that matters.,"Hello everyone :)

In the recent light of events with some TV series, and some videogames that didn't had the Ending they should, they unfortunately lost a lot from their glamour and status.   

Now, in our case' it is talked openly that the next GoW might be the last one for Kratos (See Jutunheim Mural Theory, etc.)

I'm gonna speak open and from the heart: 

I'm not ready for this.  

I don't want to see it happen.   

I also don't think it *should* happen.      

It is indeed very important to go when it's the right time, and go at your peak.   
That's what makes changes an elite game into legendary (if it's not already).    
I just feel there's still more to give, and as technology and gaming art (direction, photography, cinematics, etc.) progress, so does Kratos.   

I would love an Egyptian/Mayan/Asian addition.   

As for the Ending???  

Well, the Olympus throne is vacant... 
And Greece needs a God at Olympus, so why not a happy ending after we've enjoyed a little bit more Kratos? üòä",4,public,Spoilers
GodofWar,t3_bqwue0,"Loved the game, but disappointed with the ending","Spoilers, of course!

Now, I know that I was never going to defeat Odin and Thor in the first game of what will most likely be a series, but they put way too much build up and foreshadowing for those characters only for them... have no meaningful role in the story. Thor only shows up in a secret ending, Odin never makes an appearance.

When the game ended in the realm of the giants, I thought I had finished just one third of the game because there were so many loose endings to deal with. For example, what happened to the realm of the elves after we helped the white ones? What was that big bird in Norse Hell that we didn't fight and it looked very much like it was going to be a boss, given that this is GoW and fighting big enemies is a must? And what about all the locked realms like Asgard that kept teasing us that there would be more?

Feels like they meant for this game to be huger, but then they ran out of budget. This game was going to be a 10/10 if they kept going on, but that ending left a sour taste in my mouth. I would give a  maximum of 8/10 because of the journey.",0,public,Spoilers
GodofWar,t3_bqkggf,Minerva's Tapestry,"The natural assumption is to think that the series title ""God of War"" relates to Kratos inheriting the mantle when he defeated Ares.  However, I believe Barlog and company are actually playing on a Phantom Menace theme insofar as the larger multiple mythology arc being manipulated by a hidden hand .

Athena is also one of the Greek gods of war (war and wisdom to be precise) and she has also now appeared in both mythologies influencing the actions of Kratos.  What if she is the god of war for which the franchise is named?

Roman and greek gods are commonly viewed as being one in the same with the roman equivelent of Athena being Minerva.  One story attributed to Minerva is that she once wove a tapestry for a competition that depicted her defeating all of the other gods.

Barlog and the SMS crowd have proven exceptional students of mythology.  What if Athena/Minerva is using Kratos as her instrument for defeating **all** gods (her literal and figurative designs being woven to plan).  This would likely mean that when SMS does decide to wrap up the franchise she will likely be the final boss.",5,public,

GodofWar,t3_bqe7t1,"Just finished off the story, have a couple questions","1. Is there any story that happens after returning from jotunheim? I‚Äôm aware that there is a secret ending (I‚Äôll check it out tomorrow) and that there‚Äôs probably some bit of story after defeating all the valkyries. But other than those, do I have the full story?

2. I read an article about new game plus that says you keep the blades of chaos. Does the game address the fact that you already have them at all? Or do you return home when Atreus gets sick to ‚Äúget‚Äù the blades anyway?

3. I swear I remember Mimir or maybe Freya saying at one point that Freya was cursed to be unable to use magic to harm another being. However, during the fight with Baldur, the things that she summons definitely do damage, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the shockwave attack from the giant did some damage. Am I just missing something, or maybe I‚Äôm misremembering, or did the devs mess up?

4. I did this playthrough on GMAC difficulty. How much harder would new game plus be on GMGOW? Am I going to be getting one-shotted by basic enemies, or is it a small difficulty increase?

5. General opinion on axe vs blades? To me the blades only feel useful for runic attacks and if I‚Äôm up against a horde of low power enemies. For single targets or groups of strong enemies I almost always prefer the axe.

6. After picking up Mimir at the end of the game, he says Brok and Sindri took a bunch of measurements of him. Any idea what those are for?",11,public,
GodofWar,t3_bqj2bp,GoW 5 and how Kratos Being Dead Could Work (Slight Spoilers),"I‚Äôve been a fan of the franchise for about a decade now. Despite what many people have said, this newest game is not the first time they have told a deep and meaningful story. All the past games are a tragedy about a man‚Äôs anger, hate, and selfishness, and how that brings the downfall of him, his loved ones, and the whole world. Really, it‚Äôs the anger and fear of everyone, which is a consistent theme in the original games. The new game doesn‚Äôt work nearly as well unless you know about the past adventures of Kratos, as they provide subtext for who he is, what he has done, and what he is capable of.

One of the things I wanted clarification on in 4 is, exactly what happened after 3? For all we know, the world could have restarted, this time with a Norse Pantheon, and it has been thousands of years, since Kratos is immortal. Past events have really only been touched on, and I think they need to be fleshed out in 5. It could explain who Tyr is, the giants, if there are multiple worlds (Greek, Norse, Egypt, Japanese). Most importantly, it would explain what Kratos‚Äô sacrifice at the end of 3 really meant.

At the end of 4 we saw something that looked like foreshadowing of Kratos death. Anyone who has played the past games knows that you can‚Äôt really keep Kratos dead. He has canonically in pretty much most of his games, and he always escaped from the Underworld. That‚Äôs how bad ass he is. It seems like they might want to keep him dead, and the only way for that to work, is if he chooses to do so voluntarily.

Kratos is still carrying the sins of his past. One of the things that stood out to me, was the whole thing about him killing his father. Really, killing Zeus is at the bottom of the list of ‚ÄúWorst Things Kratos Has Ever Done‚Äù. Most obviously, his skin, which represents him murdering his family, ranks way up there. It is still a thing, but it is never alluded to as far as I know in 4. I think they were waiting to exfoliate further in the future.

I think Kratos should choose to stay dead, either after a sacrifice to save Atreus or someone else. It is well in his power to stay alive, but after his journey of really becoming a new man, he wants to truly atone for his sins. The world that he ended up destroying. He chooses to stay dead as a way to pay back everyone he has killed. And in the end, he meets his family, the one that he killed, and the ash from his skin peels away. I think that would be a beautiful way to end his story. It would represent him truly being free of his guilt, which has been his goal from literally the first screen of the original GoW 1. Of course, there is his other wife Faye, who I am not really attached to, since we never saw her and is newer, but I think she could be involved as well. Atreus learns from the example that Kratos‚Äô has taught him, and picks up the mantle.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Kratos chooses to stay dead to atone for his sins. He meets his family and his ash-colored skin turns back to it's original color.",0,public,Spoilers

I have axe fully upgraded and blades are 1 upgrade from max. Can't remember what armor by name but I know it's one of the purple sets with the red shoulder guard. 

Is it this difficult for you guys as well? Is it a gear/stat thing or is my skill just not honed enough. I understand how to parry and dodge but with enemy swarms and the camera it's hard not to take a hit every now and then between kills.

GodofWar,t3_bpt6ue,Question about combat/difficulty settings,"I just bought a PS4 and God of War yesterday, and I‚Äôm starting the game on Normal difficulty. 

I love the graphics and storyline so far, but I‚Äôm finding the combat a bit confusing and difficult to adapt to. I‚Äôm not someone who‚Äôs usually *great* at games, but I play virtually all story modes on ‚Äònormal‚Äô difficulty and don‚Äôt usually have an issue until late stages of the game. 

god of war is challenging for me though. It‚Äôs the first time in a game where I‚Äôve died multiple times in a row at very early tutorial-like stages of the story, mostly because I‚Äôm struggling with when to throw the axe, when to fight up close, when to block, and when to tell the kid to shoot arrows. 

Is this something I‚Äôll get the hang of as I continue the game? (I just started towards the mountain) Or will it get more difficult if I‚Äôm already struggling in the early stages?

I love the game and I know there are parts in the game that don‚Äôt happen in Norse mythology like the story of Jormungandr being sent back in time as a result of Ragnarok which is a short story minor tells but have I missed any story about the forging of Mjolnir other than Brokkr and Sindri claiming to have forged it in the end?

GodofWar,t3_bpr7k5,My worry about the sequel(s),"First off I'd like to say, before playing this game I fucking hated Kratos. After playing GoW1-3 I found Kratos to be an irredeemable prick, which is why I put off playing this game for so long. Last week on a whim, I borrowed the game from a friend and finished(100%) it today, and I was thoroughly impressed. The game was so fucking good. To illustrate how much I enjoyed it: Spider-Man was a good game but I wouldn't buy a system for it, God of War is so goddamn good that I would buy a PS4 for it.

So my point is that one of the main reasons I enjoyed this game so much, as opposed to any of the previous games in the franchise, is its story. The premise to be more precise. Instead of an epic quest or a vengeance quest, it's just a personal journey for a father and son to fulfill their dead wife/mom's final wish. Whatever conflict that happened between the duo and the Aesir just so happened cause the gods got in their way.

So my worry is, especially cause of the implications of the ending, that the sequels won't be able to do the same set-up. Sure I'll probably still enjoy the ride, but I fear that I won't be as happy as I am with this one.",13,public,

For anyone wondering:

Hel's touch (consistently stuns her), River of knives(also stuns consistently and deals a lot of damage),Nemean crush, Hyperion Grapple, Talisman of the Realms

The best axe pommel is the forbidden grip of ages because it makes Pride of the Frost your strongest normal move.

Every time she does the Staff aoe, hit her with an axe throw, Hyperion grapple and Nemean crush her and then use the talisman to spam blade switch stance heavy attack. This deals a lot of damage and there's nothing she can do abou it. For everything else, punish with pride of frost.

The undodgeable I'm talking about is when she does the wing swipe into a guard breaking attack. You can't dodge out of the way of the guard break (if you can, I wasn't able to). Sometimes she also does the unblockable wing stab out of nowhere (only seen it when her eyes glow)

Zeus armor and Sindri chest+. Cannot imagine how long it would take without Zeus armor.

Atreus' only uses are wolves for free stun, resurrection stones and the occasional healing stone that *might* make a difference (ground fire and small ice shards don't instantly kill you)

GodofWar,t3_bprqjs,God of war theories for God of war 2,"This theory is thought by me, I do not know if someone has posted it before


God of war 2 (Nordic Saga)

I would start with kratos in the sindri and brok store (the one in the temple of Tyr in the lake of the 9) talking to them while they improve the ax (with some new skill).

In the conversation between Sindri, Brok and Mimir (who would follow in the waist of kratos) comment that the Fimbulvetr is ending but that during the great snowfall the lake has frozen.

That at this moment you just improve the ax and they tell you to go to the lake of the nine (completely frozen) to taste it. At that moment you see that the platform to call Jormungandr goes down and that she drops Atreus (and notes as a tremor that jormungandr has moved) and tells you that she has been talking to her (friends)

At that moment you are ready to go to the lake of the 9 to try it. (Here would start the gameplay) You kill a couple of enemies to get control of the character and the ax (as a tutorial plan, as in previous games)

Once killed a couple of enemies, as Sindri and Brok have told you that the Fimbulvetr is running out a kinematics that the frozen ground of the lake begins to break and has to run to the temple of Tyr, while enemies chase you (more than anything they run so that they do not fall into the water either) at the end kratos and atreus arrive at the temple before the ground thaws.

After this they would go home with the portal in the store.

(This part that I just described would be like the tutorial of the game, as the part since you start at 1 until before the fight with baldur, but in the game that takes about 40-50 min)

Once at home the final cinematic of 1 would come out in which Thor leaves, but this time it is not a dream and you have to face it. (This would be the classic boss at the beginning of the game)

The fight would be in several phases

  -  Phase 1: Thor tells us why he is going for us and kratos and atreus have no choice but to go for him. The combat would be very frenetic and spectacular (As practically everyone in the saga). Once we eliminate almost all of Thor's life, there would be a cinematic in which atreus takes the stone to travel through the portals between the kingdoms (We as a player would not know where he is going at that moment) 

  -  Phase 2: This phase would be the same as the first one but this time without daring (so you can not help us with your arrows) an equally spectacular combat with incredible Thor movements like throwing hammer rays or taking energy absorbing rays with the hammer to then attack with more force. Once removed almost the entire life bar would come another cinematic.
In this we would see how Kratos and Thor chop the Leviathan ax and the Mjolnir making sparks fly while in the distance we see Jormungandr approach in the distance with atreus on his head.
Jormungandr with anger goes to Thor to eat it, but Thor hits Kratos skyward and Thor goes with him, landing the 2 on the back of Jormungandr while this is the only thing he gets with his bite is to destroy the house of Kratos and atreus


  -  Phase 3: Phase 3 would be the last part of the fight where Thor and Kratos would fight on Jormungandr's back as it moves through the skies. By removing almost all the bar of life to Thor we would see another cinematic where we would see that Thor goes to the head of Jormungandr running, and just when he reaches it jumps and charges the hammer with thunder falling from the sky to strike a death Punch.
Jormungandr would fall dead on the lake of the nine, falling on top of the temple of Tyr destroying it completely while Kratos and atreus jump from its back to the mainland along with Thor. Thor would realize that he has just killed his mortal enemy of Ragnarok thinking he can dodge the prophecies that he would die at the hands of Jormungandr. So he would quickly go to Asgard to tell the other gods that prophecy can be avoided and that no one is certain death. This would make Thor even more arrogant than he already is by believing he can not die (he's clearly wrong)

This would no longer be the continuation of the game but the continuation of the fight against Thor

In the same game but later (possibly at the end of the game) Kratos and Thor (Thinking Thor who is immortal) would fight, but Kratos would kill Thor with the ax that would be impregnated with the poison of the serpent (This happens the first time we we find Jormungandr in God of War, when Kratos throws his ax to the lake of the 9 and returns the ax to us, in that precise moment in God of War we get a message saying Imbuido de Eitr or Eirt Imbued in English)

This would be my beginning and the death of Thor for the next God of War

I beat the game a year ago when it first came out and put it aside since I had other games to play at the time. I started it up last night to try and 100% it and start over on NG+. The first thing I did was went into the skills to start purchasing everything I didn't already have and noticed some of Talon Bow upgrades were locked stating I had to upgrade the bow first before I could unlock them so I went to see Brok and Sindri. I can't find the upgrade bow option anywhere in the upgrade section.

It's honestly fascinating to watch now, knowing where the series went after Ascension turned out lackluster. Something that really stands out is that a lot of what these guys are saying- particularly Jaffe and Barlog- seem to foreshadow the direction taken by God of War PS4. It's even clearer after watching [Raising Kratos](https://youtu.be/lJZWKBDXXFY). Some examples: 

Jaffe says that Kratos' story is essentially a guy who puts work in front of his family and loses them. Made me instantly think of Christopher Judge's interview in the doc.

Apparently Barlog was the one who came up with Kratos hugging his wife and child during the Ares fight, which added emotion to the fight.

There was plenty of talk about how they wished they could have dived more into Kratos as a person.

GodofWar,t3_bpeer9,A guide to skap slag and XP/hacksilver exploits in NG+,"Anyone who's tried to upgrade equipment in new game plus will know just how expensive it all can be. Purchasing and fully upgrading a full set of armour can cost over a million hacksilver and almost 200 skap. If you're looking to upgrade all the armour, pommels and talismans then expect to have to do around 4-5 full playthroughs of the game, and to repeatedly grind the challenge realms for rare crafting materials.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is a certain quirk in the game that can be exploited to farm XP and/or skap slag at a rate that can net you very large amounts in no time. The exploit utilises the way the game saves progress. In certain situations, if you complete a labour you will be awarded XP for it. However if you are killed in combat, or restart from last checkpoint before proceeding to the next one, then the labour is reset to where it was before the encounter, but you still keep the XP you were awarded. To give an example, if you have already shattered 29 frozen enemies before your next encounter, then freeze and shatter the next draugr you see. Doing so will net you 3500 XP or more, depending on your multiplier (in my case I get 3500 x 1.65 = 5775 XP). Now restart checkpoint and do it again for another deposit of XP. Do this as often as you want before moving on and cashing in all your XP.

&amp;#x200B;

If you stack a few labours so they are all near completion then you could clear them all in each reset for a much larger XP injection. If the labours you complete give skap slag, then that too can be stacked in some cases, but not others (for example opening the final Jotnar shrine cannot be exploited since it autosaves and sets a new checkpoint).

&amp;#x200B;

I recorded a couple of videos to show a few examples.

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted this [first clip](https://youtu.be/MctU5hlQ2cE) before, showing a very quick and simple way to duplicate skap slag. Can be done the first time you visit Muspelheim and Niflheim. u/owkle pointed out that there was an even more efficient way to do it, so I decided to record the next clip to show it.

&amp;#x200B;

In this [second clip](https://youtu.be/4S9G5oz4IYU), I had already summoned Atreus' runic 59/60 times, discovered all hidden chambers and opened 6/7 of them. I travelled to the beach in Alfheim where the final doorway is and summoned my 60th runic for 5775 XP then opened the hidden chamber for another 3102 XP plus 9 skap (if I hadn't already discovered the door before then it might be possible to get 18 skap here, untested). Thamur's corpse is an even better choice of location for this exploit since it is much faster to reach it than this beach in Alfheim.

&amp;#x200B;

In this [third clip](https://youtu.be/GA7VKqaXKhk), I had already shattered 28/30 frozen enemies, tripped 97/100, and cleaved 45/50. Completing these labours on the first few enemies gets me 12787 XP each time.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking that last clip further, here is a [fourth clip](https://youtu.be/b1RcHjXkd5Y) showing a longer (failed) run of the 100 enemy challenge. In this one I completed the labours for shattering 30, cleaving 50, and tripping 100 enemies, killing 400 draugr, 15 travellers, and 20 trolls, for a gain of 30,000 XP in a few minutes work.

GodofWar,t3_bor2v3,[Spoilers] How powerful are the blades of chaos,"Right of the bat we are going to go into different versions of the blades so in the 2018 GOW reboot it's said that no magic or fire can be used in hell but the blades light up which goes into perfect sync of how Ares made the blades from the deepest pits of the Greek hell.

 After kratos kills Ares he receives the more powerful blades of Athena which were made with not a warrior in mind but a God during the beginning these blades are powerful enough to wound and kill a God unlike the blades of chaos. 

At the beginning of GOW 3 kratos falls into the river Styx and the blades of Athena are destroyed and rusted but are recreated into the blades of exile by Athena these are the most powerful iteration not only do they contain strong fires but they can also be infused with different other magical properties and are powerful enough to be able to destroy the heart of a Titan which aligns perfectly with what Ares wanted a weapon in the hands of a warrior that could kill a God my belief is that these blades are powerful enough to kill and defeat a Titan,God,fury even the God of death himself survive and ignite in the harsh environments of Hell what do you think of the power of these blades considering that they are kratos primary weapons.",5,public,

GodofWar,t3_boned6,God Of War Theories,"GOD OF WAR SPOILERS AHEAD

At the end of the game we see the plot twist in which Atreus reveals to his father that he is Loki. According to Norse mythology and in particular the myth of the assassination of Baldur, loki hands the mistletoe to another god (who is blind, to keep in mind), and makes him throw it at Baldur, killing him.
But if this myth had been completely ""copied"", that is, the blind god in this case was kratos who, he killed Baldur as if he were the blind god, only a link between Atreus and Baldur? In the next gow maybe you will discover with a huge plot twist, that in all this, kratos was nothing but a pawn to pave the way for Atreus for a much much bigger journey?
If so, having empathized a lot with the two guys, I hope my theory will be denied .. I don't know if I could handle it emotionally xD

GodofWar,t3_boon1g,What gods would you like to fight?,"Hello everyone, I just finished another run of GoW and I started to wonder and appreciate how the creators managed to create some many different and unique fight with the bosses from the Greek trilogy to the current norse game, now after giving some thoughs and playing a bit smite, I started to wonder if the franchise continues, what gods would the people of this subreddit would like to fight more than anything.

My personal top 5:

1)Susano: The god of the storm and the most violent among the shinto pantheon, I am sure Kratos will get a lot of fights with him because of his short temper, besides his powerful sword could be a good match against the blade of chaos

2) Set: This guy is a shapeshifting and one of the most evil jerks in the egyptian pantheon, seriously this guy actually could even be a great main villain for a whole trilogy

3) Sun Wukong: While I know this fight could be one sided since Wukong is very OP but c'mon Wukong vs Kratos has a lot of potential to be one of the most espectacular fight of the franchise, since the monkey king has a lot of varieties of magic and martial techniques that can add a lot of unique mechanics and a veyr flashy fight

4) Bellona: Roman Goddess of war, although I think i want this fight more because I want to see the reaction of Kratos at the moment he sees a new pantheon of gods dominating Greece with Iron fist again.

5) Huƒ´tzil≈çp≈çchtli: This guy is the god of human sacrifices, sun and war, basically the patron god of the aztec empire and a very vicious one. Basically Kotal Kahn from the new mortal kombat games got huge inspirations from this guy",2,public,
GodofWar,t3_boderk,The feeling of growing up with Kratos.,"Some spoilers ahead. You've been rewarned.

When the first God of War came out, I was about 15. It was clearly an adult game with loads of violence and sex. Initially took an interest because for a ps2 game it looked amazing, then I played it. And realised that the graphics and scale were just the beginning. The two major sequels after that were true to form and incremental improvements. 2nd one was a slight letdown in terms of not being able to slay major gods. 3 was incredible. The violence, the personal nature of the rage, the ascension of Athena after the fall of Olympus, the Blades through all this. All amazing. Special notable point, its exclusives like this that have kept me with the ps consoles. Once I played GoW3, I thought maybe this is the end.
Then a new God of War was announced. And they didn't call it 4. I knew things would change, I didn't know whether I wanted that or not.
I'd been trying to look up reviews and because of some algorithm I received this YouTube notification which showed me that Athena and the Blades were in this game. I then decided I didn't want to know. I got the game on digital, thought they deserved full price with no middle men after all this time.
By God, did they deserve it. From the first fight with Baldur, every Valkyrie, the Elves, the puzzles, the storytelling and the portrayal of a calmer and more intelligent father. Kratos was a father in game 1 but he didn't really embrace it until game 3 where he suddenly felt fatherly for Pandora. 

Also one huge thing that changed between the original series and now is that I became a big brother to a sister 18 years younger than i. The whole father figure thing started to make sense. I understood Kratos well in this game and from the documentary it was clear that Cory Barlog reshaped Kratos because of his little girl. Weird how that worked out. Whether it was the emotion of Freya wanting to protect her son by sacrificing herself, or Kratos accepting his fate as just being a vehicle for Arteus becoming what he's meant to be. The strong ties of family and friendship binds you to the story of the game. And the Valkyries, they help you to value your soul because, you pretty much have to give a part of it to survive those beasts.
It's been a journey, maybe God of War has been a total of 200 hours of my life. But those 200 have affected me as a person, whether it's about having an outlet for rage whilst being entertained or to truly understand humans, humanity and growth. The 4 game console journey along with one handheld one has shown me things I won't otherwise have known, but most importantly it has given me the timely life lessons of controlling and using your rage, moving on from tragedy, and finally valuing relationships like nothing else has.
Kratos has been raised well.",23,public,Spoilers

That was one of the nicest moments in my gaming ""career"".    

&amp;#x200B;

It is so pleasant to finally get  to see all suits, and gear, as also to get that complete depth that this game has to offer, and all that for free' no extra charge.  

So Thank You Santa Monica Studios, that was that sweet cherry on top of that masterpiece you made.  

&amp;#x200B;

One think I would like to mention for the sequel of the new God of War, is that I would very much like it if we could continue from our last save on this game.   

One thing that has switched me off and got me exhausted about the previous games of the series, was that somehow Kratos would always magically lose absolutely all his gear and powers and start  over again, and again, and again (so the games are challenging and you get to build up gear and abilities), but that's something that is absolutely not necessary any more.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of losing everything for some X silly reason, Kratos (us) could keep all that he worked for, and find better gear and more abilities on the other game.   

The mobs don't need to be level one and we fighting with a stick again.  

They can be level 12.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now a question if I may to this beautiful community:   

&amp;#x200B;

For the very first time, I've made the perfect game. Every labour, every secret, raven, chest, favour, in all realms, is completed except one: out of all collectibles, I've missed the second legendary chest on The Mountain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is that after the demolitions, there is no way up any more as it seems (?) and I'm stack at this sad 99.99% accomplishment.   

&amp;#x200B;

Is this chance blown forever in this game, or does someone knows a way to that second chest in the Mountain?

&amp;#x200B;

As now many of us have played the game (I assume) and try to have second looks on it, I've noticed a few details and have some thoughts to share.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, even though it becomes repetitive, it's something that has to be said: hands down in the top 10 videogames of all time. The cinematography, the music, the arc, the graphics, and the amazing details have topped everything we've seen and are second to none in its category.

&amp;#x200B;

A few thoughts about the story:

&amp;#x200B;

In the game we see Tyr who as God of War in Norse Mythology appears as kind, wise, peaceful, trying to avoid bloodshed, and undo injustice.

In the Greek Mythology, his equivalent Ares is portrayed as a polar opposite of Tyr: weak, sneaky, coward running from battle, stealing and deceiving, bloodthirsty, and schizophrenic.

By all means, Ares is the very worst of all Hellenic Pantheon.

Now, it is not mandatory to take these analogies to Kratos word by word, but what I do perceive from the arc, is that the Kratos of Greece that was more like Ares, is phasing into Tyr as he is adventuring in the Norse lands.

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of the game, the brilliant script is showing us Kratos on ""Greek Mode"" at his peak: he is indifferent, stoic, careless, and in a Spartan Survival mode. He minds his own business, does not interfere if there is no necessity to interfere and he is literally Laconic. Does what he must do and doesn't what is he mustn't.

If Kratos has to go from A to B, and next to B is a baby being murdered by someone that is not an obstacle to him, he'll not interfere.

All this changes as he spends time with his child and sees things from Atreus' perspective, as also the paternal instinct kicks in, and transmits into a benevolent God of War by seeing what Tyr has done in this narrative.

This can be seen specifically at Jotunheim when he firstly accepts his past, and is ready to be a FATHER.

He hides his blades no more, and seems that he is not going to be dismissive to any Atreus' questions about his past as he did before.

...and then... the murals at Jotunheim. He realises that everything was destined to happened for a reason, and sees his own death on the hands of his child, as the Serpent that kills him comes out of Atreus'/Loki's mouth, ergo he is at his command, or even the same.

And he accepts that. The moment they scatter Frey's (Freyr) ashes, he **knows**, he is **free**, he has **accepted** what comes, and has made his peace with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Two things to be taken into consideration too, are firstly Mimir's comments for Atreus' after the boy lost control and attacked his father.

***""You know brother, you know the boy's true nature""***

Atreus has a **dark side**, and I think we are going to see it as he also phases into Loki.

The second moment to take into consideration is at the fight with Baldur in front o Freya, when he knows that she will willingly give her life for he child, no matter how monstrous he might be.

That's what every father or mother does, and after what he sees at the Jotunheim mural and his change into a real father, Kratos now realises what must happen and accepts it.",49,public,Spoilers

GodofWar,t3_bn8qmq,Ramblings about GoW‚Äôs camera,"I was recently watching a Game Maker‚Äôs Toolkit video about cameras in games where Mark talked about some of the problems he had with the game‚Äôs camera. Specifically that it took the existing wide shot which combat took place in in past games and made it completely over-the-shoulder instead. So I started thinking about the camera and what purpose was served by changing it so much from the original games. And this is what I came up with: 

The original GoW games were all about player empowerment. Badass combos, sexy ladies to bang, screen-clearing spells, vicious kills, these were all meant to make he player feel powerful. Yeah, there‚Äôs challenge, and significant challenge at that, but at the end of the day, these are games where you fuck Aphrodite and her handmaidens compliment your form. The new GoW isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs quiet and intimate at times and the quest that Kratos goes on is not one of hate and anger, but one of love. Ultimately, Santa Monica was trying to distance this game from the others and especially distance the game from the toxic masculinity present in those first games. This is done in part by no focusing on player empowerment. Instead, Kratos is vulnerable. He feels more than just anger and goes through real struggle. This is where the camera comes in. In gameplay, the camera sticks to you, giving you a limited view. This leaves you open to attacks that are only indicated by the arrows. You are open, exposed, vulnerable. And this can make a player angry. But it‚Äôs supposed to. You cannot succeed until you accept the Kratos‚Äô vulnerability and embrace it. You feel like a god once you master the combat system, when you can quick turn and dodge just in time only by using the arrows and sounds. That is when the player feels empowered. When they learn to embrace and accept their vulnerability. 

I might be looking too deep into this, and I probably didn‚Äôt explain myself well, but I just needed to get this out. And if you disagree, that‚Äôs fine. I might just be a butthurt fanboy. Also, this was not meant to be me shitting on Mark Brown. I fucking love GMTK, I just disagreed with the guy‚Äôs opinion. 

Tl;dr The camera in GoW makes you feel vulnerable and that‚Äôs the point.",15,public,

GodofWar,t3_bn5cao,"SPOILER - GOD OF WAR THEORY: LOKI IS A TIME TRAVELLER, AND TYR, THE GOD OF WAR. - SPOILER","First of all, I must say that I really believe in this theory. I have been discussing about God of War with my friend, and I may don't have all the questions, but I really think my theory do explain some things.

1- THE TIME TRAVELLING: In the norse mythology, Loki marries the Jotun(Giant) Angurboda, and with her, have three kids: Jormungandr, Fenrir and Hela. Wich two of them, are already present in the game. Jormungandr and possibly Hela. But how? Since the Giants are already all dead and Loki is a kid, how would all of this happen? It won't. Because it already did. Loki is a time traveler. Not the actual Loki that we see and play with, but a Loki in a soon, very soon future. That's why we already have Jormungandr, Fenrir and Skoll and Hati in the game, all of them being descendant of Loki. Because Loki travelled back in time, maybe with Jormungandr, I don't know. But when he did, he lived hundreds or maybe thousands of years before he even comes to existence. That's the reason why the Ragnarok is coming faster than predicted, and why Jormungandr recognized Atreus, because he is it's father.

2- TYR: During the game, we are hinted that Tyr is a God Of War that searched peace, which made us think that maybe Kratos was Tyr. But that was wrong. Like Atreus, Tyr always tried to help people and was good all along. According to the God of War fandom: **""T√Ωr is a Norse god associated with war and heroic glory in Norse mythology. He is typically described as only having one hand, having lost the other to the wolf** [**Fenrir**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir)**.""**. ( &lt;[https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/T√Ωr](https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/T√Ωr)\&gt; ) Tyr lost his arm to Fenrir. I can't explain why Fenrir would attack his own father, but it at least connects the two characters. According to the game, Tyr is one of Odin's sons. And that matches exactly with Loki. Loki is adopted, but is considered son of Odin. And that would explain why is Odin so obsessed with Kratos and Loki, sending Baldur after them. Maybe he already knows about it. In the Norse apocalypse, the Ragnarok, **""*****Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world"".*** *( &lt;*[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki)*&gt; ).*

&amp;#x200B;

What if Loki, the adult one, that travelled back in time is still alive?  We can see throughout the whole game, that the mother ALWAYS knew where Kratos would go, and what decisions he would make. Preparing the ground for Kratos, marking the way.  Maybe because she has hinted to do so. Maybe because there was someone, that already lived all of this, guiding her and helping her to create and accomplish a prophecy. Not because she saw the future, but because she had with her someone that LIVED it. Loki is the one that manipulated all of this, all of the story. I wouldn't expect nothing less from the God of Manipulation.

But, as far as the game goes, it really wouldn't make much sense to wield the inferior weapon, considering the dwarves created the weapon with flaws that impeded the extent of Thors damage 

Some of the flaws are its incredibly unbalanced and heavy weight, the fact that mythologically the hammer requires a special belt just to wield it, its incredibly short handle meaning it has an extremely short attack reach and even the fact the weapon does not serve as a medium of creating thunder

You can argue the hammer is flawed only in part of its weight and short handle only but the Leviathan Axe was created in the hopes of equaling and even surpassing Mjolnir

So I‚Äôve recorded these events and will upload them later when I have the chance.  I‚Äôm under the current impression I take no damage during the time attack. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

- Glitches/events that have stopped me from completing the trial (come to 65 kills, each event/glitch caused 30 sec- 1 minute delay) 

 - Got hit with witch‚Äôs frozen breath - Kratos then froze still, a bunch of staggering animations occurred (with no hits on him) and I died. ressurected at full health somehow using berserker stone, was still for at least 20-30 seconds.

 - Twice now, around 2:30 minutes, a poison reaver stays inside the spawn point. One time it took me ages to kill him. (He had a shield. Felt like it took at least a minute.) Would not come out. I was definitely going to make it that time. 

 - The worm that burrows can not be knocked off the side. ( Haven‚Äôt recorded this but it simply will not happen.) I feel like this is intended. Unless stunned and execution thrown off the side. Anyone confirm? 

- Anyways, anyone struggling with this trial, the valk armor has yielded me the best results.

Kratos would probably deliver some one-liner before kicking in Thor's shit and the surrounding environment until someone interrupts their fight (probably Odin or something).

Unfortunately, that double boss fight was a one-time-only event which was quite a bummer since it was such a nice mix of fun and challenge. Hopefully, Santa Monica does more of this in the sequel; fighting two gods at the same time that is. Story wise, it'd show that Kratos is such a threat that even with gods teaming up, they still couldn't beat him.",87,public,Spoilers

GodofWar,t3_bmjcob,How to Duplicate Skap Slag in NG+,"I've seen quite a few people recently asking what is the fastest way of getting large amounts of skap slag so I thought I'd post a quick guide. [Video here](https://youtu.be/MctU5hlQ2cE)

You can do this at Niflheim and Muspelheim as long as you haven't already visited those realms before. Travel to one of those realms and pass through the first two doorways. This will give you a notification that you have received skap slag, and your inventory will have increased by 9 pieces. Restart checkpoint. You will keep the skap but be able to pass through the doors again for more. You can keep doing this as long as you want, as long as you never proceed to the next checkpoint. Once you've stocked up to your satisfaction, restart checkpoint again then travel back to Midgard. With this method you can get 9 pieces every 35-40 seconds.",39,public,

GodofWar,t3_bmn833,Idea for GOW 2,"Kratos and Thor have an epic battle, Kratos loses to Thor, both gods are on the brink of death, Kratos loses consciousness, Thor is still awake but in a bad shape and because of this he doesn't have the energy to kill a god.

After sensing the boy's godly presence, and realizing that Norse gods are now in short supply right before Ragnarok begins, Thor subdues Atreus (Loki) with magic and kidnaps him to train him as his apprentice. Thor brings Atreus to Odin to erase his memories of his past. Odin, being all-knowing, realizes that Kratos is a hard god to kill, seeing as he has killed; the entire Greek pantheon; Titans; many mythical beasts; 3 of the Norse gods; himself multiple times and returned, and almost killed Thor. Odin realizes that the only one who can kill Kratos for good, is his son. Odin uses his magic to trick  Loki into believing that Kratos is the demon prophesized to bring Ragnarok and destroy Valhalla.

Kratos is trapped in Midgard, fighting through the relentless hordes of Ragnorok to get to Valhalla-- this takes years.

In this time his beard shows some signs of aging.

He finally arrives and Loki is in his late teens/ early 20's, and after years of indoctrination and magic, he (literally) sees Kratos as the Norse equivalent of the Devil-- his appearance to Loki reflects that/ a different appearance to what we know Kratos to look like.

In the absence of his own sons, Loki grows on Thor and Thor thinks of him as his adopted son which is reciprocated by Loki-- there is a genuine and unspoken bond between them, like father and son.

Loki has the power of a young Kratos with a Norse twist, he is capable of using all of the powers of the Norse gods. He has a rage identical to that of Kratos, potent but uncontrolled and, reckless and psychopathic like Baldur.

Loki is much more powerful than Kratos, especially since Kratos is old and Loki is young.

Kratos kills Thor.

&amp;#x200B;

This is as far as I am going, for now.

If this gets enough upvotes I'll carry it on-- with better grammar etc.

GodofWar,t3_bmmw84,Question about level design.,"I've been a long time Souls fan. If you've had the pleasure to play Dark Souls 1, you would know everything is connected; that if you were to look down Firelink Shrine and see Blightown, that was the actual place, not a low polygon place to just look. I was wondering if this game did the same. I'm playing the game for the third time and when I reached &gt;!the top of the mountain where Mimir is!&lt; I looked down and saw Freya's orange forest, Krato's house surrounded by the yellow barrier, as well as the lake of nine. Are those the ACTUAL places? Or just a low polygon version of them that make the illusion? Has this been confirmed? Maybe for many of you, it's not a big deal, but you gotta appreciate when a game has a good level design.",9,public,
GodofWar,t3_bmskrm,The Trials in Ascension are Hell Incarnate and I refuse to suffer any longer.,Fuck this part of this game. I played on Normal and now all of a sudden they want to spike the difficulty with Gorgons and Sirens who don't stagger and take way too long to die compared to other GoW games? Wtf!? Everything was going fine up until this point. I threw my controller at the screen and punched a wall I was so mad at this piece of shit game. I maxed out my Elements and Chaos Blades and that still didn't help me? Wtf. And some how this game is Canon? Bullshit. This game should've never been made. I was playing thw GoW games in Chronological Order and Yesterday I beat Chains of Olympus and skipped Ascension because that Trials part is needlessly difficult. I decided to give it another shot but no. It's still a clusterfuck of hard and hell. Fuck Ascension. I watched the ending on YouTube and have no shame.,0,public,
GodofWar,t3_bml2oy,"[Spoilers] Just beat Sigrun, on my first try...","I don't know how this is possible? I am playing on give me a challenge btw and just before opening the realm tear I was legit shitting my pants about what was to come as the last 2 valkyries were a pain in the ass (Geirdriful and Hildr) so I was assuming the worst but I guess the repeated attacks and nothing new of the sort except the health bar didn't make it much of a challenge (atleast for me apparently) I did die once but used the Superior Resurrection stone to bring myself back giving me half a health bar but I had already gottwn Sigrun down to 1/8th of hers and used the light and heavy runic attack on my axe and there she was done. Glad that I finished the game in it's entirety except Odin's ravens (fuck those tbh) but a bit disappointed that Sigrun didn't have any new moves of her own and was kind of easy to beat compared to some of the other Valkeryies.

I have one question for the people who have started new game+.. What all is carried forward? Are your resources, armor, runic attacks, enchanments and other things also carried forward or is just the blades and axe that are? Also is hecksilver and exp carried forward? 

Thanks :)",5,public,Spoilers
GodofWar,t3_cayaif,Muspelheim sucks,"I love muspelheim but man sometimes do I hate it, whoever came up with the idea of giving the challenge (kill 100 enemies) is just as cruel as Thor.

GodofWar,t3_cay6dp,I just beat the last valkyrie,"After hours of having much fun playing this game, I decided that my journey won't be over after being through the main-story. I wanted to go on trophy-hunt, to be sure that I won't miss anything in the game.

I decided that slaying the valkyries should be the last thing to do in order to have an epic ending to the game. So after everything else was finished, I started.

You know, I'm not very good at this game. I played it for the experience and not for the challenge and therefor, I knew that those fights would bring to my border. But somehow, I managed to get past the first 8 valkyries after many tries, especially Gondal from Muspelheim brought me to my knees.

I thought that my trophy would be almost safe..

This was before I met Sigrun.

I don't know what in this world made her so angry, but she surely knew how to release it on me. I never stood a chance, her movement was to fast for me to react, her attacks to strong to reflect. I went multiple times right into my certain death when releasing her.

I had to change something.

I did the research and decided to grind for thr best gear possible for this one fight. I spent much time again in Niflheim to prepare myself for the fight, I wasn't worthy enough for.

And I saw progress. The stronger gear helped me as well as kind hints from strangers in the inter lnternet. Eventually it took me up to 20 tries. It was by far the most satisfying victory I ever had.

I won't forget what happened there.",31,public,Spoilers

GodofWar,t3_cax27s,God of War give me challenge is insane,"Iam soulbourne veteran , 
I never died more than two times in bloodborne bosses including DLC, 
But with GoW give me challenge,  i died in the tutorial alone more than the whole bloodborne and ds2 combined ,
One mistake and Iam ruined , 
Even on troll fight I had to throw my axe at him the whole fight like a wuss 
I don't feel as a God of War , I feel like an old daddy trying to act tough ,
I continued to play on give me challenge until the revenant appeared , and then after dying dozen of times, I humbled myself and put my ego down and lowered the difficulty to "" balanced experience "" 
And man that was a change,  now I feel like GoW , i can execute combos and finishers , i can accumulate rage i can play more aggressive,  the game is still hard and i die every now and then,   but at least i feel i enjoy the game now and not punishing myself ,
I really don't wanna imagine how ""Give me God of War "" looks like",2,public,
GodofWar,t3_cayf8l,"My experience with the combat of the ""new"" god of war","Before I say anything I just want to say that I love the game and that its easily one of my favorites out there and the game is a blast to play, but at times it can get pretty annoying, and that is usually the combat. I get how they decided to completely change the combat with the game and its not like I miss the old combat so much that I hate the new one, I just find myself having to do braindead stuff more often than in the old gow games. Said braindead stuff being just throwing the axe ten thousand times because if you let your guard you'll get two shotted. I'm not saying its like that all the time but its usually when there's a lot of revenants or nightmares involved, and its just boring to throw the axe all the time. The combat gets more fun in the mid/late game cuz throwing the axe like a monkey is no longer viable and the enemies are not as cancer altho there will still be a few revenants showing up at times downgrading the experience. Another complain is the lack of good bosses. The ogres I feel are probably less interesting than the cyclops from previous games. I might be exaggerating but you get my point, and the soul eaters are easily the worst and most boring bosses that they could implement into the game. You literally have to throw the axe to them 10 thousand times and then just spam R1 whenever they're stunned. I do admit there are a few fun bosses like the valkyrie and magni with modi but other than that boss encounters dont excite me. I completed the game on hard and im thinking of completing it again on very hard or ng+ so if there's anything else that changes in the combat or mechanics of the game and generally things I should look out for please do let me know",0,public,Spoilers
